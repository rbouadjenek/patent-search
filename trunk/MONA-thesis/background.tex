\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{cha:background}
In this chapter, first, we briefly explain the structure of patents, then we cover both general IR methods and patent-specific IR methods.
\section{Structure of Patents}
\label{StructureofPatents}
A patent is a structured document, which consists of 
title, abstract, description, citations, inventors, and several other sections.
The text of a patent document is saved
%electronically in the patent office 
as an XML file with specific fields corresponding to each
section or subsection in the patent document and some additional meta-data about the patent
document itself (Figure~\ref{fig:PatentXML}). However, users usually get access to a text document --- not an
XML document~\citep{magdy2012toward}.

In this section, we briefly explain the main sections and meta-data of a patent document that are commonly used in a patent retrieval system as follows:
\paragraph{Title}
\ \\ 
The title of the patent appears in three languages --- this is a feature in European Patent Office\footnote{\texttt{http://www.epo.org/}} (EPO)
patents, where the title is stated in English, French, and German. 
\paragraph{Abstract}
\ \\ 
Abstract is a short paragraph that contains
a summary of the invention. This section is not always present in EPO patents since it is an
optional section.
\paragraph{Description}
\ \\ 
This section of the patent document represents the core of the invention, since it contains all the
technical details of the invention. It consists of a set of paragraphs that describe all the aspects of
the invention in detail. The description
section can contain tables, experimentation on the performance of the invention, and description 
of figures relating to the invention. The first paragraph of the description section usually contains
information about the topical field of the invention. The references to other patent
documents are very important information within the description text. 
These references are part of the citations that a patent
examiner would be interested to examine in order to measure the contribution of the invention
against prior art. 
\paragraph{Claims}
\ \\ 
The claims section of the patent document lists what aspects of the invention that the patent is
going to protect. A successful patent does not have to have all its claims accepted, but at least one
of them must be. The examination can lead to dropping some of the claims by showing that they
are not novel. This usually happens because patent applicants try to generalize their invention as
much as possible, which can lead to the novelty of some of the very general claims being found to
be invalid.
The claims section in EPO patents contains the list of claims in three languages (English,
French, and German). However, this is not the situation for the initial patent application, where
the claims are submitted in one language only, which is the language of the document. The
claims translations are only provided for the granted patent.\\\\
Nonetheless, patents contain
additional material, such as: tables, mathematical and chemical formulas, citations,
technical drawing, meta-data, e.g., applicant, inventor, Intentional Patent Classification 
(IPC) codes, and publication date, that can be used to improve the retrieval effectiveness.
IPC codes and citations has been widely applied in patent retrieval. 
\paragraph{International Patent Classification (IPC) Code}
\ \\ 
In 1971, the Strasbourg Agreement established the International Patent Classification (IPC) under the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which divides technology into eight discrete Sections. The goal of this
Agreement was to overcome the difficulties caused by using diverse national patent classification systems.~\citep{harris2010comparison}

A patent is assigned to one or more of the 71,000 IPC codes that 
indicate the related technical field or fields the patent covers. 
These codes are arranged in a hierarchical, tree-like structure with 
five distinct components. Figure~\ref{fig:ipcexample} illustrates the components of an IPC classification.

The highest hierarchical level contains the eight sections of the IPC corresponding
to very broad technical fields, labeled A through H. For example, Section C deals
with``Chemistry and Metallurgy''. Sections are subdivided into classes. The eighth edition of the IPC contains 120
classes. Class C07, for example, deals with ``Organic Chemistry''. Classes are further subdivided into more than 600 subclasses. Subclass C07C, for example, deals with ``Acyclic or Carbocyclic Compounds''. Subclasses are then further divided into main groups and subgroups. Main group symbols end with ``/00''. Ten percent of all IPC groups are main
groups. For example, main group C07C 35/00 deals with ``Compounds having at
least one hydroxy or O-metal group bound to a carbon atom of a ring other than
a six-membered aromatic ring''. In some versions of the IPC, a series of numbers will follow the subgroup, reflecting
the enactment date of the IPC version. `20060101' following the Subgroup
indicates a date of January 1, 2006, which is the date that the eighth version of
the IPC took effect.

   \caption{An example illustrating the main components of an International Patent Classification code.}   
   \label{fig:ipcexample} 
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Patents are assigned at least one classification code 
indicating the subject to which the invention relates, this is called Main Code. They may also be assigned further classification and 
indexing terms to give further details of the contents of the invention, which are called Further Codes. 

\paragraph{Citations}
\ \\ 
This section of the patent document contains the list of older patents that are related to the
invention by describing the relevant parts of the prior-art of the invention, or these citations can
be for patents that have been located by the patent examiners and were found to invalidate parts 
of the invention in the initially submitted patent application, where the final version of the patent
get these parts modified or removed.
\section{General Information Retrieval (IR)}
An information retrieval (IR) system assists users in finding the information they need. Figure~\ref{fig:generalir} illustrates the general IR process; First, a repository of indexed documents is created from a collection of documents to be searched for. Users formulate the information they need as a query and the IR system answers the query intent. In the matching process, the query and documents representations are compared and the result would be a ranked list of documents. The first attempt at formulation of a query with a particular information need in mind
is often inaccurate and can result in an answer set that does not satisfy the user's information need. 
After reading some of the documents in the initial result set, the query can be reformulated in order to shift the result set toward the information need.

\subsection{Multi-stage Retrieval}
It is common to use patent meta-data and non-textual features as pre and post processing steps of text-based retrieval techniques~\citep{lopez2009multiple}. Many patent retrieval tasks re-rank the top retrieved documents from initial retrieval stage based on additional patent feature~\citep{lopez2010experiments}, claim structure ~\citep{mase2005proposal}, and considering IPC information of patent and its neighbours to retrieve similar patents~\citep{verma2011exploring}.
