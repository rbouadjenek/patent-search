Upon the accomplishment of this thesis, I would like to thank people who influenced and enlightened my academic path. 
First, I owe a debt of gratitude my gratitude to the main director of this research: Scott Sanner. I have been quite fortunate to work on another research advised by him before he leaves NICTA/ANU to Oregon State University. He highly encouraged me  (1) to work hard, but with enthusiasm, (2) to feel responsibility for honest contribution to science, (3) to be an independent and efficient thinker (4)  to collaborate with other researchers, and (5) to deal with a research problem by proposing to-the-point research questions and (6) to be brave enough to examine new ideas and to seek for the best solution. I hope I have learned enough to continue my academic career even without his ultimate and unselfish support. I believe that the science world needs more people like Scott. I would like also express my gratitude to Bob Williams --- the leader of the Machine Learning group of NICTA. He created such a positive research atmosphere and culture with a collection of excellent researchers at NICTA that made my tenure at NICTA an extraordinary fruitful experience.
In addition, I thank my other committee members, Tom Gedeon (chair of my panel), Gabriela Ferraro, and Hanna Suominen for their supports over the course of my MPhil. Gabriela has always been for me when I needed and Hanna kindly reviewed and commented on my thesis. 

During my one-year MPhil program, I met many successful IR researchers like Paul Thomas (and his IR \& friends seminars), Milad Shokuhi, and Leif Azzopardi who left a strong impact on my career. I would also thank David Hawking for his smart comments on my work. Dave and Scott's support encouraged me to have a submission to SIGIR that got accepted $\ddot\smile$. 

I would like also mention about my anonymous SIGIR paper reviewers for their useful comments. Their words warm my heart to stay in research and have more contribution to Computer Science/IR society. For example, I always feel confident to go forward when I read their following comment on my paper: "Although the amount of work on patent query reformulation was large since 2010, but none of this work did that simple but interesting study. The study and results are very interesting and can be very useful for patent examiners in practical search situations". I owe the presentation of my work at Chile (Santiago) to generous SIGIR travel award and ANU fund. 

I appreciate Reda Bouadjenek, for his contribution to the baseline IR framework. I would like also thank Ehsan for patiently answering my technical questions (Of course, Scott taught me a priceless lesson, which will be with me forever: "Google is your best friend!" $\ddot\smile$).

And finally, I am grateful to all of my family and friends for being there for me whenever I needed. An special thanks to my dearest Ali for always being my main support after my parents and respecting my attempts to follow my goals and values.
