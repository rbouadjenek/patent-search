Once again, I was honored to work on another research problem advised by a great academic and scientist: Scott Sanner, in the last year he was at NICTA/ANU. His ability to formulate a research problem, as well his enthusiasm in thinking and solving a problem incredibly encouraged me to spend long hours to get the results for our thoughts. Our weekly meetings have been always fruitful and full of discussions over great research ideas. I hope I have learnt enough about the art of being an effective thinker for my future research career. Next, I would like to thank a great scientist who influenced me and my research career: Bob Williams. I benefited and inspired a lot from weekly seminars at NICTA and his support to attend NICTA Machine Learning Summer School.  

I would like to thank Reda Bouadjenek for his contribution to the development of the baseline system.
