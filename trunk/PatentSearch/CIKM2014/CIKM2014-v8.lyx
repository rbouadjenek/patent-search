\begin_layout Abstract
Patents are used by entities to legally protect their inventions and represent
 a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing and litigation.
 In 2012, 276,788 patent applications were approved in the US alone -- a
 number that has doubled in the past 15 years.
 While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework of the
 CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in assessing prior
 art for complete patent applications, less of this work has focused on
 patent search with shorter queries representing (partial) titles, abstract,
 or claims to help inventors assess the patentability of their ideas prior
 to writing a full application.
 Hence, in this paper, we focus on both helping inventors to assess the
 patentability of their ideas and patents examiners to assess the patentability
 of a given patent application.
 Specifically, we propose a deep analysis of query reformulation methods
 that are targeted for patent prior art search.
 We also propose query reformulation methods that exploit the specific structure
 of patent documents as well as methods aimed to improve recall with a limited
 set of query expansion terms.
 We demonstrate that our methods improve both general (MAP) and patent-specific
 (PRES) evaluation metrics for prior art search performance on standardized
 datasets of CLEF-IP, with respect to both general and specific query reformulat
ion methods.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Patents are used by entities to legally protect their inventions and represent
 a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing and litigation.
 In 2012, 276,788 patent applications were approved in the US alone a number
 that has doubled in the past 15 years.
 Hence, helping both inventors and patents examiners to assess the patentability
 of a given patent application through a patent prior art search is a critical
 task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Patent prior art search involves finding previously granted patents that
 may be relevant to a new patent application.
 The objective and challenges of standard formulations of patent prior art
 search are different from those of standard text and web search since
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

: (i) queries are full patent applications, which consist of documents with
 hundreds of words organized into several sections, while queries in text
 and web search constitute only a few words; (ii) patent prior art search
 is a recall-oriented task, where the primary focus is to retrieve all relevant
 documents at early ranks, in contrast to text and web search that are precision
-oriented, where the primary goal is to retrieve a subset of relevant documents.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework of the
 CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in assessing prior
 art for complete patent applications, less work has focused on assessing
 the patentability of inventions before writing a full patent application.
 Prior art search with shorter queries that represent unfinished patent
 applications is certainly desirable, since writing a full application is
 time-consuming and costly, especially if lawyers are hired to assist.
 However prior art search with partial applications is much different than
 queries with a full application -- namely because the queries are much
 shorter and represent only parts of a patent application.

To assess the difficulty of querying with partial patent applications (such
 as the title, abstract, claims, or description sections), we refer to Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:FailureAnalysis"

\end_inset

.
 Here we show an analysis of the average Jaccard similarity (fraction of
 overlapping terms after removing patent-specific stopwords) between different
 queries (representing the title, abstract, or claims of a patent application)
 and the labeled relevant (all) and irrelevant documents (top 10 non-relevant
 documents ranked by BM25).
 We show results for the top 100 and bottom 100 queries of CLEP-IP 2010
 evaluated according to MAP.
 There are three notable trends here: (i) term overlap increases from title
 to description since the query size grows accordingly; (ii) the bottom
 100 performing queries tend to have much smaller term overlap with the
 relevant documents than the top 100 queries; and (iii) the best overlap
 for any relevant document set for any set of queries is less than one in
 four terms.
 While these results suggest the description section may be the best part
 of a partial patent application to use for a query, there is still significant
 room for improving the overlap of query terms with the relevant documents,
 which suggests an investigation of

Query Reformulation is the process, which consists of transforming an initial
 query

\end_inset

 to another query 
\begin_inset Formula $q'$
\end_inset

.
 This transformation may be either a reduction or an expansion of the query.

 to improve retrieval performance.
 In exploring QE for patent search with partial patent applications, there
 are many configuration options and associated questions that we can consider:

A query is always evaluated against the full content (title, abstract, claims,

 Critical questions are: (i) what part of a partial application an inventor
 should write to obtain the best search results? (ii) what part of a patent
 application a patent examiner should use to make a patent prior art search?

 For initial retrieval of documents in the

 subsequent re-retrieval with an expanded term set, there are various options
 for the relevance ranking model.
 In this work, we explore a probabilistic approach represented by the popular
 BM25

 A natural question is which relevance model works best for QE for patent

Term selection method:

 Once we have identified a query expansion source, we may consider different
 methods of selecting terms for expansion.
 A standard method for term selection is based on the Rocchio

\end_inset

 approach, but in the next subsection, we introduce an alternate term selection
 method intended to address the high-recall nature of patent prior art search.
 Then a natural question to ask is which term expansion method works best,
 and with which expansion source and retrieval model? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we proceed to evaluate the above questions, we first define a novel
 term selection method to address a potential deficiency of Rocchio as used
 in practice for high-recall search that we term MMRQE.

While space precludes a full discussion, we remark that as a term selection
 method in QE, Rocchio derives a score for each potential query expansion
 term and in practice, the top-
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 scoring terms (often for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ll200$
\end_inset

) are used to expand the query and are weighted according to their Rocchio
 score during the second stage of retrieval.
 The caveat of this approach is that given a limited budget of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 expansion terms, there is no inherent guarantee that these terms

\begin_layout Standard
We begin our formal description of MMRQE by first defining some necessary
 notation.
 MMRQE takes as input a pseudo-relevant feedback set of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 documents (PRF), which is obtained after a retrieval for the initial query.
 From the PRF set, we build a document-term matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 documents and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 terms as shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:notation"

\end_inset

, which uses a TF-IDF weighting for each document vector (row 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq i\leq n$
\end_inset

).
 However, as we will see shortly, the view that will be important for us
 in this work is instead the term vector (column 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq j\leq m$
\end_inset

).
 To represent the query 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 column vector in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:notation"

\end_inset

 having a numerical entry for every document 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

, we found that computing the BM25 or TF-IDF score between each document
 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the query provided the best performance (in our experiments, the score
 used is given by the indicated relevance model).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a query representation 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, we aim to select an optimal subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 terms 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}\subset D$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $|T_{k}^{*}|=k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ll|m|$
\end_inset

) relevant to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 but inherently different from each other (i.e., diverse).
 This can be achieved by building 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal term 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 given the previous set of optimal term selections 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}^{*}=\{t_{1}^{*},\ldots,t_{k-1}^{*}\}$
\end_inset

 (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}^{*}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

) using the MMR diverse selection criterion:

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the first cosine similarity term measures relevance between the query
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and possible expansion term 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}$
\end_inset

 while the second term penalizes the possible expansion term according to
 it's cosine similarity with any currently selected term in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 trades off relevance and diversity and we found 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0.5$
\end_inset

 to generally provide the best results in our experiments on the CLEF-IP
 training dataset collection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key insight we want to conclude this section with is simply that MMRQE
 does not select expansion terms independently as in practical usage of
 Rocchio, but rather it selects terms that have uncorrelated usage patterns
 across documents, thus hopefully encouraging diverse term selection that
 covers more documents for a fixed expansion budget 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and ideally, higher recall.

\begin_layout Standard
A patent application is composed of the following sections: title, abstract,
 description, and claims, which are of progressively increasing length.
 While the title is usually between three and ten terms in length, the other
 section are longer, ranging from ten to thousand terms in length.
 Hence, query expansion may be not useful for these sections, and we propose
 to investigate query reduction as an alternative.
 Query reduction (QR)

 provides insight into the utility of query reduction for the abstract section
 of the Topic PAC-1019 from the CLEF-IP 2010 data collection.
 The baseline query, which is the original query (provided in the header
 row) after stemming and patent specific stopword removal, had an average
 precision (AP) of 0.280 and a patent retrieval evaluation score (PRES) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Magdy2010a"

\end_inset

 of 0.777 (its performance are provided in the footer row).
 We show the evaluation performance of the query after removing each term
 from the original query.
 The removed terms have been sorted in the order of decreasing PRES.
 We can observe that there are ten terms that if they are removed from the
 query, we increase PRES of the original long query.

 “Oracle” refers to the situation when all terms with negative impact are

 This gives us an upper bound on the performance that can be realized through

 It is this statistically significant improvement in performance through

In the next section we propose a new method for query reduction based on
 MMR that we term MMRQR.

MMR Query Reduction (MMRQR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the same motivations than those which led us to propose MMRQE,
 we propose to greedily rebuild the query from its terms, while choosing
 diversified terms.
 Formally, given a query representation 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, we aim to select an optimal subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 terms 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}\subset Q$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $|T_{k}^{*}|=k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k<|Q|$
\end_inset

) relevant to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 but inherently different from each other (i.e., diverse).
 This can be achieved by building 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal term 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 given the previous set of optimal term selections 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}^{*}=\{t_{1}^{*},\ldots,t_{k-1}^{*}\}$
\end_inset

 (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}^{*}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

) using an adaptation of the MMR diverse selection criterion as given in
 Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:MMRQE-QR"

\end_inset

.
 Note that the we used all the sections of the patent documents of the PRF
 set to built the document-term matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 documents and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 terms shown in Figure

.
 The English test sets of CLEF-IP 2010 and CLEF-IP 2011 correspond to 1303
 and 1351 topics respectively.
 In our implementation, each section of a patent application (title, abstract,
 claims, and description) is indexed in a separate field.
 Hence, when a query is processed, all fields in the index are targeted
 as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:IndexFields"

\end_inset

.
 We also used the patent classification (IPC) for filtering the results
 by constraining them to have common classifications with the patent topic
 as suggested in previous works 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Finally, we report Mean Average Precision (MAP), and Patent Retrieval Evaluatio
n Score (PRES)

, which combines Recall with the quality of ranking and weights relevant
 documents lower in the ranking more highly than MAP.
 We report the evaluation metrics on the top 1000 results.

\begin_layout Subsection
Experimental Results for QE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Query Expansion Baselines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the general Rocchio approach for QE, we included two other
 patent specific QE methods as baselines.
 Motivated by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mahdabi2013"

\end_inset

, we used the text definitions of the International Patent Classification
 (IPC) codes assigned to a patent application as a source for query expansion
 --- this is denoted as 
\series bold
IPC Codes
\series default
.
 We also implemented the QE approach proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2011"

\end_inset

, which automatically generates candidate synonyms sets (SynSet) for terms,
 and use it as a source of expansion terms.
 This approach has two variants: (i) The first one used the probability
 associated with the SynSet entries as a weight for each expanded term in
 the query (denoted 
\series bold
WSynSet
\series default
).
 Therefore, each term was replaced with its SynSet entries with the probability
 of each item in the SynSet acting as a weight to the term within the query.
 (ii) The second one neglected this associated probability and used uniform
 weighting for all synonyms of a given term (denoted 
\series bold
USynSet
\series default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relevance model and term selection options give us seven QE algorithms
 to evaluate.
 When MMRQE is used in combination with the VSM, the additional terms use
 the weights provided by the Rocchio method, whereas when using MMRQE and
 Rocchio with BM25, there is no need to weight the terms.
 For all methods, their parameters were fixed to their optimal values, which
 were estimated using the CLEF-IP training queries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we discuss the results of the evaluation performed on the
 QE methods described above.
 But before, we first discuss the effect of the size of the PRF set on the
 performance.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tbl:PFRSize"

\end_inset

 shows the impact of the PRF size on the performance for the two QE algorithms
 Rocchio and MMRQE.
 These results are shown on the CLEF-IP 2010 training queries, which consists
 of 196 topics.
 We observe that the best QE performance results are obtained when using
 few documents in the PRF set as it was also reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2011"

\end_inset

 (in our case, the top five gave the best results).
 This is certainly due to the fact that a large PRF set set will include
 too much irrelevant documents, whose the terms may negatively affect the
 quality of the expanded query.

\begin_layout Subsection
Experimental Results for QR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Query Reduction Baselines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a general QR method, we proposed to adapt the Rocchio method for query
 pruning.
 Basically, the idea is once we have computed the Rocchio modified query
 vector, we take only terms of the initial query that appear in this vector
 and rank them using the Rocchio score.
 Then, we remove 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 terms with the lower score.
 We refer to the approach as 
\series bold
RocchioQR
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding patent specific QR methods, we implemented the approach proposed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ganguly2011"

\end_inset

.
 This technique decomposes a query (a patent section) into constituent text
 segments and compute the Language Modeling (LM) similarities by calculating
 the probability of generating each segment from the top ranked documents
 (PRF set).
 Then, the query is reduced by removing the least similar segments from
 the query.
 This approach is denoted 
\series bold
LMQR
\series default
.
 Finally, we also proposed a baseline method that use IPC codes for query
 reduction as follows: (i) For each patent application, we take the definitions
 of the IPC codes which are associated to it.
 Then, (ii) we rank the terms of the query according to both their frequency
 in the class code definition, and their frequency in the query.
 Finally, (iii) we remove bottom terms of this ranking from the query (i.e.
 good terms are terms that occur a lot in the query, and few in the class
 code definition, whereas bad terms are those that occur few in the query,
 and a lot in the class code definition).
 The intuition is that, terms in the IPC code definition may represent "stopword
s", especially if they are rare (unfrequent in the patent application).
 We denote this approach 
\series bold
IPC Codes
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relevance model and term selection options give us eight QR algorithms
 to evaluate.
 Similarly, the parameters of all methods were fixed to their optimal values,
 which were estimated using the CLEF-IP training queries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we discuss the results of the evaluation performed on the
 QR methods described above.
 As recommended in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ganguly2011"

\end_inset

 and confirmed in our own experimentation (not shown due to lack of space),
 best QR performance results are also obtained when using few documents
 in the PRF set (in our case, the top five gave the best results).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DivImpactMMRQR"

\end_inset

 shows the impact of the diversity parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 on the performance of MMRQR.
 The results are shown using BM25 retrieval model, and using abstract and
 claims for querying.
 Throughout our experiments, we concluded that the best value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is 0.8, which indicates that few diversification in term selection can provide
 some improvement.
 It is clear that if we consider only diversification to select terms (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

), the overall performance are significantly degraded.
 This is certainly due to the fact that if we consider only diversified
 terms in the query, there is a loss in the meaning of the query.

 Hence, following this methodology, some algorithms of patent query reduction
 have been proposed to select only useful terms from patent application

 for QR as a baseline, and we showed that the performance of MMRQR outperform
 this approach in many cases.

Similarly, query expansion has been widely explored for patent search.
  Magdy et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 experiment a set of classic techniques of query expansion, which rely on
 pseudo-relevance feedback and WordNet as source of expansion terms.
 However, none of these approaches were able to achieve a significant improvemen
t over the baseline.
 Therefore, they introduce a novel approach that automatically generates
 candidate synonyms sets for terms, and use them as a source of expansion
 terms, which showed significant improvement with respect to the baseline.
 We also used this approach as a baseline in our experiments, and we showed
 that MMRQE provides better performance in many cases.
 Also, Bashir et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 propose a query expansion with pseudo-relevance feedback.
 They proposed to select relevant terms for the expansion process using
 a machine learning approach, by picking terms that may have a potential
 positive impact on the retrieval effectiveness.
 However, this approach can be computational expensive, since the presented
 features are complicated to compute.
 Verma and Varma 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Verma2011"

\end_inset

 propose a different approach, which instead of using the patent text to
 query, they use its International Patent Classification (IPC) codes as
 query which are expanded using the citation network.
 The formed query is used to perform an initial search.
 The results are then re-ranked using queries constructed from patent text.
 Throughout our experiments, we concluded that relying on other terms to
 form a query rather than those in the patent application, leads to poor
 retrieval quality.
 Therefore, the approach proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Verma2011"

\end_inset

 doesn't guarantee to obtain good performance.
 Lastly, a more recent work by Mahdabi et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mahdabi2013"

\end_inset

 propose both a query reduction and expansion method.
 For the query reduction process, they just shorten the query document by
 taking the first claim since it contains the core of the invention.
 For the expansion process, they propose to build a query-specific patent
 lexicon based on the definitions of the IPC.
 Then, this patent lexicon is used to select expansion terms that are focused
 on the query topic.

 search, which reflect real-life scenario of examiners, who form reproducible
 boolean queries

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper we analyzed general QE and QR methods for patent prior art
 search with incomplete patent applications on two patent retrieval corpora,
 namely CLEF-IP 2010 and CLEF-IP 2011.
 We demonstrated that QE methods are critical for short queries, i.e.
 title, abstract, and claims, but useless for very long queries, i.e.
 the description section.
 We also showed that claims are the best section that works with QE both
 to query with and to use as a source of query expansion terms, and that
 a new method MMRQE improves QE results in many cases.
 Future work can look at more patent-specific methods of QE for prior art
 search with partial patent applications and how they can be integrated
 with methods like MMRQE.
 Regarding QR methods, we showed that these techniques are effective to
 some extend for claims and description sections, which are considered as
 the longest sections in a patent application.
 We also demonstrated that our new QR methods MMRQR may improve both recall
 and precision in many cases.
 For this second part, future work may consist in exploiting query quality
 predictors to identify useless terms in a query using machine learning
 methods.
