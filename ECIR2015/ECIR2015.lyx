\begin_layout Abstract
Patents are used by entities to legally protect their inventions and represent
 a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing and litigation.
 In 2012, 276,788 patent applications were approved in the US alone -- a
 number that has doubled in the past 15 years.
 While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework of the
 CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in assessing prior
 art for complete patent applications, less of this work has focused on
 patent search with queries representing (partial) applications to help
 inventors to assess the patentability of their ideas prior to writing a
 full application.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Patents are used by entities to legally protect their inventions and represent
 a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing and litigation.
 In 2012, 276,788 patent applications were approved in the US alone a number
 that has doubled in the past 15 years.
 Hence, helping both inventors and patent examiners assess the patentability
 of a given patent application through a patent prior art search is a critical
 task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Patent prior art search involves finding previously granted patents that
 may be relevant to a new patent application.
 The objective and challenges of standard formulations of patent prior art
 search are different from those of standard text and web search since
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

: (i) queries are (partial) patent applications, which consist of documents
 with hundreds of words organized into several sections, while queries in
 text and web search constitute only a few words; (ii) patent prior art
 search is a recall-oriented task, where the primary focus is to retrieve
 all relevant documents at early ranks, in contrast to text and web search
 that are precision-oriented, where the primary goal is to retrieve a subset
 of relevant documents.
 Another important characteristic about patent patent prior art search is
 that, in contrast to scientific and technical writers, patent writers tend
 to generalize and maximize the scope of what is protected by a patent,
 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%by using a combination of abstract and specific terminology, 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and try to make sure that finding any relevant prior work by the patent
 examiner is a hard job.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework of the
 CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in assessing prior
 art for complete patent applications, less work has focused on assessing
 the patentability of inventions before writing a full patent application.
 Prior art search with queries that represent unfinished patent applications
 is certainly desirable, since writing a full application is time-consuming
 and costly, especially if lawyers are hired to assist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%However prior art search with partial applications is much different than
 queries with a full application -- namely because the queries are much
 shorter and represent only parts of a patent application.

 We show results for the top 100 and bottom 100 queries (100 queries that
 perform the best, and 100 queries that perform the worst) of CLEP-IP 2010
 evaluated according to Mean Average Precision (MAP).
 Note that, while the title section is usually composed by an average of
 six terms, the other sections are longer, ranging from ten to thousands
 of terms.

\begin_layout Standard
There are three notable trends here: (i) term overlap increases from title
 to description since the query size grows accordingly; (ii) the bottom
 100 performing queries tend to have much smaller term overlap with the
 relevant documents than the top 100 queries; and (iii) the best overlap
 for any relevant document set for any set of queries is less than one in
 four terms.
 Therefore, we suggest an investigation of 
\emph on
query reformulation

 methods as a means for improving the term overlap between queries that
 represent partial patent applications and relevant documents, with the
 objective of assessing not only the performance of standard query reformulation
 methods, but also the effectiveness of query reformulation methods that
 exploit patent-specific characteristics.
 In this paper, we try to mainly answer the following questions: 
\emph on
What are these patent query reformulation methods and how do they work?
 What is the best section in a patent application to use as a query? What
 is the best patent query reformulation method? To which extent are they
 efficient compared to standard query reformulation approaches?

, which rely on pseudo-relevance feedback and WordNet as source of expansion

 However, none of these approaches were able to achieve a significant improvemen
t over the baseline.
 Therefore, they introduce a novel approach that automatically generates
 synonym sets for terms, and use them as a source of expansion terms, which
 showed significant improvement with respect to the baseline.
 Also, Bashir et al.

 propose a query expansion with pseudo-relevance feedback.
 Query expansion terms are selected using a using a machine learning approach,
 by picking terms that may have a potential positive impact on the retrieval
 effectiveness.
 However, this approach can be computational expensive, since the presented
 features are complicated to compute, e.g.
 Pair-wise Terms Proximity features.
 Verma and Varma 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 propose a different approach, which instead of using the patent text to
 query, use its International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, which are
 expanded using the citation network.
 The formed query is used to perform an initial search.
 The results are then re-ranked using queries constructed from patent text.
 Throughout our experiments, we concluded that relying on non-patent terms
 to expand a query, leads to poor retrieval quality.

 Even these methods are interesting, they are not suited to deal with short

As a term selection method in QE, Rocchio derives a score for each potential
 query expansion term and in practice, the top-
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 scoring terms (often for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ll200$
\end_inset

) are used to expand the query and are weighted according to their Rocchio
 score during the second stage of retrieval.
 The caveat of this approach is that given a limited budget of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 expansion terms, there is no inherent guarantee that these terms

MMRQE takes as input a pseudo-relevant feedback set of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 documents (PRF), which is obtained after a retrieval for the initial query.
 From the PRF set, we build a document-term matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 documents and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 terms as shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, which uses a TF-IDF weighting for each document vector (row 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq i\leq n$
\end_inset

).
 However, as we will see shortly, the view that will be important for us
 in this work is instead the term vector (column 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq j\leq m$
\end_inset

).

 and the query provided the best performance (in our experiments, the score
 used is given by the indicated relevance model).

Synonyms Sets for Patent Query Expansion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Magdy et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2011"

\end_inset

 proposed a patent query expansion method, which automatically generates
 candidate synonyms sets (SynSet) for terms, and use it as a source of expansion
 terms.
 The idea for generating the SynSet comes from the characteristics of the
 CLEF-IP patent collection, where some of the sections in some patents are
 translated into three languages (English, French, and German).
 The idea is to use these parallel manual translations to create possible
 synonyms sets.
 Hence, for a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 in one language which has possible translations to a set of words in another
 language 
\begin_inset Formula ${w_{1},w_{2},…,w_{n}}$
\end_inset

, this set of words can be considered as synonyms or at least related to
 each other.
 The generated SynSet is used for query expansion in two ways: (i) The first
 one use the probability associated with the SynSet entries as a weight
 for each expanded term in the query (denoted 
\series bold
WSynSet
\series default
).
 Therefore, each term was replaced with its SynSet entries with the probability
 of each item in the SynSet acting as a weight to the term within the query.
 (ii) The second one neglected this associated probability and used uniform
 weighting for all synonyms of a given term (denoted 
\series bold
USynSet
\series default
).
 This strategy is similar to adding synonyms from WordNet where no probability
 is assigned.

Patent Lexicon for Query Reformulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mahdabi et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mahdabi2013"

\end_inset

 proposed to build a query-specific patent lexicon based on definitions
 of the International Patent Classification (IPC).
 The lexicon is simply build by removing general and patent stop-words from
 the text of IPC definition pages.
 Each entry in our lexicon is composed of a key and a value.
 The key is an IPC class and the value is a set of terms representing the
 mentioned class.
 Then, the lexicon build is used to extract expansion concepts related to
 the context of the information need of a given query patent.
 To this end, the IPC class of the query patent is searched in the lexicon
 and the terms matching this class are considered as candidate expansion
 terms.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Query expansion using the lexicon is expected to solve the two problems:
 (i) The first problem is related to the fact that the usage of words is
 sensitive to the topic domain; In different domains, the same word may
 be used to indicate different meanings.
 We aim at finding the correct sense of a word, by associating relevant
 terms from the topic domain to the given query terms for each query patent.
 (ii) The second problem is related to the term mismatch.
 The vocabulary of the query patent is tailored by the language usage of
 the author (a non-standard terminology), while conceptual lexicon provides
 a more standard terminology.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The approach proposed tries to combine these two complementary vocabularies.

Patent Query Reduction Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, consider the following three patent query reduction methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Maximal Marginal Relevance for Patent Query Reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the same motivations than those of explore diversification for
 term selection, we can imagine greedily rebuild the query from scratch,
 while choosing diversified terms (i.e.
 terms of the query).
 Here, we call this approach MMR Query Reduction (MMRQR).
 Formally, given a query representation 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, we aim to select an optimal subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 terms 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}\subset Q$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $|T_{k}^{*}|=k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k<|Q|$
\end_inset

) relevant to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 but inherently different from each other (i.e., diverse).
 This can be achieved by building 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal term 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 given the previous set of optimal term selections 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}^{*}=\{t_{1}^{*},\ldots,t_{k-1}^{*}\}$
\end_inset

 (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}^{*}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

) using an adaptation of the MMR diverse selection criterion.
 Note that the we used all the sections of the patent documents of the PRF
 set to built the document-term matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 documents and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 terms shown in Figure

Language Model for Query Reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ganguly2011"

\end_inset

, the authors proposed a query reduction technique, which decomposes a query
 (a patent section) into constituent text segments and computes a Language
 Modeling (LM) similarities by calculating the probability of generating
 each segment from the top ranked documents (PRF set).
 Then, the query is reduced by removing the least similar segments from
 the query.
 We refer to this method by 
\series bold
LMQR
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
IPC Codes for Query Reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the intuition that, terms in the IPC code definition may represent
 "stop-words", especially if they are rare (infrequent in the patent application
), one can think to reduce a patent query as follows: (i) For each patent
 application, take the definitions of the IPC codes which are associated
 to it.
 Then, (ii) rank the terms of the query according to both their frequency
 in the class code definition, and their frequency in the query.
 Finally, (iii) remove bottom terms of this ranking from the query (i.e.
 good terms are terms that occur a lot in the query, and few in the class
 code definition, whereas bad terms are those that occur few in the query,
 and a lot in the class code definition).
 In the evaluation section we denote this approach 
\series bold

 CLEF-IP 2010 contains 2.6 million patent documents, and the English test
 sets of CLEF-IP 2010 correspond to 1303 topics.
 We also made the same experiments on the CLEF-IP 2011 dataset, but for
 lack of space we omit the results from the paper.
 However the obtained results was almost similar and presented the same
 trends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our implementation, each section of a patent (title, abstract, claims,
 and description) is indexed in a separate field.
 Hence, when a query is processed, all fields in the index are targeted,
 since it is sensible to use all available content.
 We also used the patent classification (IPC) for filtering the results
 by constraining them to have common classifications with the patent topic
 as suggested in previous works 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Lopez2009,Roda2009"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, we report MAP, and PRES 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which combines Recall with the quality of ranking and weights relevant
 documents lower in the ranking more highly than MAP.

Gabi said: a review from ckim commented that the ipc filter could be too
 restricted taking into account that patent applications usually dont contained
 revised ipc codes.
 But, if I remembered correctly, when you turn off the filter the results
 were no significant different and you decided to keep the filter on, since
 the systems works faster.
 Is that true? .
 If yes, we should commented in the paper.

Query Expansion Results

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we discuss the results of the evaluation performed on the

 But before, we first discuss the effect of the size of the PRF set on the
 performance.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 shows the impact of the PRF size on the performance for the two QE algorithms
 Rocchio and MMRQE.
 These results are shown on the CLEF-IP 2010 training dataset, which consists
 of 196 topics.
 We observe that the best QE performance results are obtained when using
 few documents in the PRF set as it was also reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2011"

\end_inset

 (in our case, the top five gave the best results).
 This is certainly due to the fact that a large PRF set will include too
 much irrelevant documents, whose the terms may negatively affect the quality
 of the expanded query.

 For lack of space we show only the results of queries extracted from the

 From these results, we make the following observations: (i) for the two
 retrieval models (VSM and BM25), MMRQE provides the best performance for
 both MAP and PRES (except for MAP, where Rocchio BM25 provides better performan
ce than MMRQE BM25), (ii) for both MMRQE and Rocchio, the best performance
 is obtained while adding no more than 50 terms to the original queries
 (adding more terms may have no effect, or decrease the performance), and
 (iii) exploiting external sources for query expansion provides poor performance
 (IPC code definition and SynSets).

\end_inset

, show the performance obtained for all the QE methods, while selecting
 the optimal number of terms used for the expansion (number of terms that
 maximizes the performance for each method).
 From these results, we first observe that the best section to use for querying
 is the description section (see Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:qDescription-MAP-CLEF-IP2010"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:qDescription-PRES-CLEF-IP2010"

\end_inset

).
 We attribute this to the fact that the description section has more content
 along with relevant terms that define the invention since a detailed summary
 of the invention is described therein.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to our experiments, the best source for query expansion is the
 claims section.
 We attribute this to the fact that, the claims contain not only relevant,
 but also, specific terminology, since the scope of the invention is described
 therein.
 However, when querying using the claims, other sources of query expansion
 provided better performance.
 This may be because claims are very similar between them and contained
 specific terms; consequently, the queries lack of diversity and general
 terms or synonyms that are used to describe similar inventions.
 It is interesting to notice that the description is not either a good source
 for expansion, since its content is too broad, therefore, it contains many
 irrelevant terms that hurt the performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As expected, we observed that query expansion is not useful for very long
 queries (i.e.
 description), indicating that in advanced stages of the patent application
 process, QE is not relevant.
 We also notice that when dealing with more mid-long queries such as abstract
 or claims, MMRQE is more effective than Rocchio, which suggest that diverse
 term selection is not crucial for short queries.
 We also note that using the IPC code definitions (as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mahdabi2013"

\end_inset

) and SynSet (method of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2011"

\end_inset

) as a source of expansion, gave poor performance (see IPC Codes and SynSet
 bars along the Figures).
 Finally, regarding the best term selection method, we conclude that in
 general MMRQE provides better performance than Rocchio.

 These results tell us mainly two things: (i) for the two retrieval models,
 MMRQR provides the best performance for both MAP and PRES, and (ii) for
 almost all methods, the best performance is obtained when removing about
 30 terms from the original queries (in the case where the description is
 used for querying).
 Removing more terms will decrease significantly the performance.

 No QR), (ii) when dealing with very long query (i.e.

 and (iii) in general, MMRQR provides better performance than the other

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper we analyzed general and specific query reformulation methods
 for patent prior art search for partial (incomplete) patent applications
 on two patent retrieval corpora, namely CLEF-IP 2010 and CLEF-IP 2011.
 We demonstrated that QE methods are critical for short queries, i.e.
 title, abstract, and claims, but useless for very long queries, i.e.
 the description section.
 We also showed that claims is the best section that works with QE both
 to query with and to use as a source of query expansion terms, suggesting
 that claims should be written at early stages of the patent application
 drafting so that they can be use to performed patent prior art search.
 In the same vein, we also found that the patent specific fields are more
 suited as a source for expansion than external sources such as synonym
 dictionaries.
 Here, future work concerns how can we exploit patent specific meta-data
 such as inventor and citation networks for query expansion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding QR methods, we showed that these techniques are effective to some
 extent for claims and description sections, which are considered the longest
 sections in a patent application.
 Future work may consist of exploiting query quality predictors to identify
 useless terms in a query using machine learning methods.
