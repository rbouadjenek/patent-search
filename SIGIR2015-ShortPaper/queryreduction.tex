The encouraging results of our Oracular Patent Query in the previous
section motivate us to explore various methods to approximate the terms
selected by this query without ``peeking at the answers'' provided by
the actual relevance judgements.  We first attempt this via fully
automated methods and then proceed to evaluate semi-automated methods
based on interactive relevance feedback methods.

\subsection{Automated Reduction}
\label{sec:AutomatedReduction}
%\vspace*{-2ex}
%We noticed that most of the useful feedback terms exist in the original query and hypothesized that the baseline system could be substantially improved by removing negative query terms. 
%
% Why these approaches? provide citations for who has suggested them or otherwise
% provide a justification as to why each approach would be a good idea.  Do this
% in the bullet points where the actual method is discussed... not after the bullet
% points!  Don't dissociate content and discuss it multiple times in different
% places!  -Scott
We used four approaches to refine the initial patent query: (i) removing document frequent terms (DF(t)>$\tau$), (ii) keeping frequent terms in query (QTF(t)>$\tau$); (iii) using pseudo relevance feedback to select query terms (PRF(t)>$\tau$); and (iv) removing general terms in IPC title. 

In standard IR approaches, removing terms, appearing a lot in the collection, helps the retrieval effectiveness. Inspired by this fact, we removed the words (in top-100 documents) with average term frequency higher than the threshold $\tau$ from the original query. As it can be seen in figure \ref{fig:queryreduc}, unlike our assumption, removing frequent terms in top-100 documents ($DF(t)>\tau$) ruined the performance.  

As mentioned in~\cite{maxwell2013compact} terms inside verbose queries are also important. Hence, we kept frequent words inside the query while removing document frequent words. The results in Figure \ref{fig:queryreduc} indicate that it is better to keep all query terms ($QTF(t)>\tau$). 

The third approach we used to reduce the query was Pseudo Relevance Feedback ($\mathit{PRF}$). $\mathit{PRF}$ is an automated process without user interaction which assumes the top k ranked documents are relevant and the others are irrelevant. Again, it can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:queryreduc} that the results for query reduction using $\mathit{PRF}$ were below the baseline. In fact, we could not find any heuristic correlates between  $ PRF(t)$ and $ RF(t)$. 

Finally, we used words in IPC code title to reduce the query assuming they are general words in all patents, which belong to the same category and may consider as stop-words. However we hurt the effectiveness by pruning them out.

% The anecdotal results and their implications have to be explained
% much more clearly... what is surprising about them (be specific:
% point out actual terms) and what can you take away from this
% investigation.  -Scott
Figure \ref{fig:anecdotal} is an anecdotal example for a sample query, which can explain why these four approaches did not work. It shows the abstract and a pair of terms, and RF score of each term, where $t \in \{t| DF(t)/QTF(t)/PRF(t)>10\} $. It can be seen that high scored terms are polluted with the sufficient amount of noise to ruin the retrieval effectiveness.   

Unfortunately, none of the proposed query reduction approaches for query reduction worked better than the baseline, which leads us to investigate interactive methods for reduction in the next section.

Abstract: The invention relates to an emulsifier, 
a method for preparing said emulsifier, and to 
its use in various applications, primarily food 
and cosmetic applications. The invention also 
relates to the use of said emulsifier for the 
creation of an elastic, gelled foam. An 
emulsifier according to the invention is based on 
a starch which is enzymatically converted, using 
a specific type of enzyme, and modified in a 
specific esterification reaction.

Our anecdotal analysis of specific queries and terms selected via our oracular
approach suggests that automated methods fall far short of optimal term selection.
This leads us to explore another approach of approximating the oracular query
derived from relevance judgements by using a subset of relevance judgements
through interactive methods.  Specifically, to minimize the need for user interaction,
in this section we analyse the performance of an oracular query derived from
only the first relevant document identified in the search results.
\begin{comment}
All our attempts to improve the system effectiveness without accessing the relevance feedback were quite in vein because the features we recognized were tightly the combination of the useful words and noisy words and the system performance is too sensitive to the existence of a noisy word or the absence of the useful terms. So, we decided to apply much more realistic approach in which feedback terms are extracted only from the first ranked relevant document retrieved. 
\end{comment}
Using this approach, Table \ref{tab:firstrel} shows that we can double the MAP in comparison to our baseline and also outperfor the best system from CLEF-IP 2010.

Furthermore, to establish the minimal interaction required by this
approach, Figure \ref{fig:FirstTPRankHisto} indicates that the
baseline methods return a relevant patent approximately 80\% of the
time in the first 10 results and 90\% of the time in the first 20
results.  Hence, such an interactive approach requires relatively low
user effort while achieving state-of-the-art performance.
