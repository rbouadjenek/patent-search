In this paper, we looked at the patent prior-art search from a different perspective. While previous works proposed different solutions to improve retrieval effectiveness, we focused on term analysis of the patent query and top retrieved patents. After finding a golden standard from relevance feedback, we examined the most obvious features such as: document frequent words, query frequent words, IPC definition words, and pseudo relevance feedback that might correlate RF score for terms in top retrieved documents. We showed that these feature helps very little because they are a complicated mixture of useful terms and noisy words that can not be separated easily. Finally, we showed that we can double the MAP with minimum user interaction. 
For future works, we plan to analyse more features which are independent from the relevance feedback but correlate with RF score. Inspired by some excellent works proposing query reduction and term selection techniques for the long non-patent queries\cite{maxwell2013compact}\cite{kumaran2009reducing}, we are also going to apply them for patent retrieval.   
%Opposite our initial assumption, features such as document frequent words, frequent words in the query, IPC code definition words, and pseudo relevance feedback could not help to refine the best query because they were the combination of useful words and noisy words and our system is too sensitive to the existence of the noisy words as well removing .
