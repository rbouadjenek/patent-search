Patent prior-art search aims to find all relevant patents which may invalidate the novelty of a patent application or at least have common parts with patent application and should be cited. Patent search has been the centre of attention in IR communities for years, however it has lower retrieval effectiveness compared to other IR applications. In this work, we focused on the causes of failure rather than solutions. We started with relevance feedback to get a golden standard, then we concentrated on heuristics correlate with our RF standard. Finally, we showed that features other than relevance feedback can not be helpful because they are a complex mixture of useful words and noisy words. Finally, we got a considerable improvement by user feedback with a minimum effort.
