\begin_layout Abstract
Patents are used by entities to legally protect their inventions and represent
 a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing and litigation.
 In 2012, 276,788 patent applications were approved in the US alone -- a
 number that has doubled in the past 15 years.
 While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework of the
 CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in assessing prior
 art for complete patent applications, less of this work has focused on
 patent search with queries representing (partial) applications to help
 inventors to assess the patentability of their ideas prior to writing a
 full application.
 
\begin_inset ERT

%Hence, in this paper, we focus on both helping inventors to assess the
 patentability of their ideas and patents examiners to assess the patentability
 of a given patent application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

In this paper, we carry out an intensive study of query reformulation for
 patent prior art search with partial patent applications, with the objective
 of assessing not only the performance of standard query reformulation methods,
 but also the effectiveness of query reformulation methods that exploit
 patent-specific characteristics.
 We also propose new query reformulation methods that (a) exploit patent
 structure and (b) leverage techniques for diverse term selection in query
 reformulation.
 We demonstrate that our methods improve both general (MAP) and patent-specific
 (PRES) evaluation metrics for prior art search performance on standardized
 datasets of CLEF-IP, with respect to both general and specific query reformulat
ion methods.

Introduction

\noindent
Patents are used by entities to legally protect their inventions and represent
 a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing and litigation.
 In 2012, 276,788 patent applications were approved in the US alone a number
 that has doubled in the past 15 years.
 Hence, helping both inventors and patent examiners assess the patentability
 of a given patent application through a patent prior art search is a critical
 task.

\begin_layout Standard
Patent prior art search involves finding previously granted patents that
 may be relevant to a new patent application.
 The objective and challenges of standard formulations of patent prior art
 search are different from those of standard text and web search since
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Magdy2012"

\end_inset

: (i) queries are (partial) patent applications, which consist of documents
 with hundreds of words organized into several sections, while queries in
 text and web search constitute only a few words; (ii) patent prior art
 search is a recall-oriented task, where the primary focus is to retrieve
 all relevant documents at early ranks, in contrast to text and web search
 that are precision-oriented, where the primary goal is to retrieve a subset
 of relevant documents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework of the
 CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in assessing prior
 art for complete patent applications, less work has focused on assessing
 the patentability of inventions before writing a full patent application.
 Prior art search with queries that represent unfinished patent applications
 is certainly desirable, since writing a full application is time-consuming
 and costly, especially if lawyers are hired to assist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%However prior art search with partial applications is much different than
 queries with a full application -- namely because the queries are much
 shorter and represent only parts of a patent application.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The Jaccard similarity is used to measure the term overlap between two sets,
 and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the
 union of the sample sets.
 Before applying the Jaccard similarity, patent-specific stopwords were
 removed, as suggested by

 descriptions intended to represent a partial patent application) and the
 labeled relevant (all) and irrelevant documents (top 10 irrelevant documents
 ranked by BM25
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

).
 We show results for the top 100 and bottom 100 queries (100 queries that
 perform the best, and 100 queries that perform the worst) of CLEP-IP 2010
 evaluated according to Mean Average Precision (MAP).
 There are three notable trends here: (i) term overlap increases from title
 to description since the query size grows accordingly; (ii) the bottom
 100 performing queries tend to have much smaller term overlap with the
 relevant documents than the top 100 queries; and (iii) the best overlap
 for any relevant document set for any set of queries is less than one in
 four terms.

While these results suggest the description section is the best part of
 a partial patent application to use as query, they also point out that
 the term overlap between the queries and the relevant documents can be
 very low.
 Therefore, we suggest an investigation of

During the exploration of query reformulation for patent search with partial

 questions that we can consider:

A critical question is what part of a partial application an inventor should

 Then a natural question is, which term selection method works best, and
 with which configuration, i.e.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we proceed to evaluate the above questions, we first define in Section

 a novel term selection method for QE that we term MMRQE.
 This method is expected to address a potential deficiency of Rocchio as

 Then, in Section

 we present MMRQR, a novel QR method, which is expected to rebuild the query
 from the scratch by selecting diversified terms.

 is a query reformulation approach that adds terms to an initial query in

 The utility of QE for patent prior art search is motivated by the term
 overlap analysis depicted in Figure

\begin_layout Standard
As a term selection method in QE, Rocchio derives a score for each potential
 query expansion term and in practice, the top-
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 scoring terms (often for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ll200$
\end_inset

) are used to expand the query and are weighted according to their Rocchio
 score during the second stage of retrieval.
 The caveat of this approach is that given a limited budget of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 expansion terms, there is no inherent guarantee that these terms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cover
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 all documents in the pseudo-relevant set.
 It seems that what we are asking for then is a method of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diverse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 term selection --- such as the

 algorithm for result set diversification.
 But rather than use MMR for diverse document selection (as typically used),
 we intend to use it here for diverse term selection.
 In what follows, we present a novel term selection method inspired by MMR,
 to address the deficiency of Rocchio, that we call MMR Query Expansion
 (MMRQE).

\begin_layout Standard
We begin our formal description of MMRQE by first defining some necessary
 notation.
 MMRQE takes as input a pseudo-relevant feedback set of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 documents (PRF), which is obtained after a retrieval for the initial query.
 From the PRF set, we build a document-term matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 documents and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 terms as shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:notation"

\end_inset

, which uses a TF-IDF weighting for each document vector (row 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq i\leq n$
\end_inset

).
 However, as we will see shortly, the view that will be important for us
 in this work is instead the term vector (column 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq j\leq m$
\end_inset

).
 To represent the query 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 column vector in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:notation"

\end_inset

 having a numerical entry for every document 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

, we found that computing the BM25 or TF-IDF score between each document
 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the query provided the best performance (in our experiments, the score
 used is given by the indicated relevance model).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a query representation 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, we aim to select an optimal subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 terms 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}\subset D$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $|T_{k}^{*}|=k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ll|m|$
\end_inset

) relevant to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 but inherently different from each other (i.e., diverse).
 This can be achieved by building 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal term 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 given the previous set of optimal term selections 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}^{*}=\{t_{1}^{*},\ldots,t_{k-1}^{*}\}$
\end_inset

 (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}^{*}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

) using the MMR diverse selection criterion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t_{k}^{*}=\argmax_{t_{k}\notin T_{k-1}^{*}}\hspace{-0.3mm}[\lambda\cos(Q,t_{k})-\hspace{-0.3mm}(1-\lambda)\max_{t_{j}\in T_{k-1}^{*}}\cos(t_{j},t_{k})]\label{eq:MMRQE-QR}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the first cosine similarity term measures relevance between the query
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and possible expansion term 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}$
\end_inset

 while the second term penalizes the possible expansion term according to
 it's cosine similarity with any currently selected term in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 trades off relevance and diversity and we found 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0.5$
\end_inset

 to generally provide the best results in our experiments on the CLEF-IP
 training dataset collection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key insight we want to conclude this section with is that MMRQE does
 not select expansion terms independently as in practical usage of Rocchio,
 but rather it selects terms that have uncorrelated usage patterns across
 documents, thus hopefully encouraging diverse term selection that covers
 more documents for a fixed expansion budget 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and ideally, higher recall.

While the title is usually composed by an average of six terms, the other
 sections are longer, ranging from ten to thousands of terms.
 Therefore, we investigate the impact of query reduction methods when querying

 provides insight into the utility of query reduction for the abstract section
 of the Topic PAC-1019 from the CLEF-IP 2010 data collection.
 The baseline query, which is the original query (provided in the header
 row) after stemming and patent specific stopword removal, had an Average
 Precision (AP) of 0.280 and a Patent Retrieval Evaluation Score (PRES) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 of 0.777 (its performance are provided in the footer row).
 We show the evaluation performance of the query after removing each term
 from the original query.
 The removed terms have been sorted in the order of decreasing PRES.
 We can observe that there are ten terms (highlighted in boldface) that
 if they are (individually) removed from the query, we increase PRES of
 the original long query.

Following the same motivations than those which led us to explore diversificatio
n for term selection, we propose to greedily rebuild the query from scratch,
 while choosing diversified terms (i.e.
 terms of the query).
 We call this approach MMR Query Reduction (MMRQR).
 Formally, given a query representation 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, we aim to select an optimal subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 terms 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}\subset Q$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $|T_{k}^{*}|=k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k<|Q|$
\end_inset

) relevant to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 but inherently different from each other (i.e., diverse).
 This can be achieved by building 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal term 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 given the previous set of optimal term selections 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}^{*}=\{t_{1}^{*},\ldots,t_{k-1}^{*}\}$
\end_inset

 (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}^{*}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

) using an adaptation of the MMR diverse selection criterion as given in
 Equation

.
 Note that the we used all the sections of the patent documents of the PRF
 set to built the document-term matrix of

 documents and

.
 CLEF-IP 2010 contains 2.6 million patent documents and CLEF-IP 2011 consists
 of 3 million patent documents.
 The English test sets of CLEF-IP 2010 and CLEF-IP 2011 correspond to 1303
 and 1351 topics respectively.
 In our implementation, each section of a patent (title, abstract, claims,
 and description) is indexed in a separate field, so that different sections
 can be used, for example, as source of expansion terms.
 But, when a query is processed, all fields in the index are targeted, since
 it is sensible to use all available content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also used the patent classification (IPC) for filtering the results by
 constraining them to have common classifications with the patent topic
 as suggested in previous works 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Finally, we report MAP, and PRES, which combines Recall with the quality
 of ranking and weights relevant documents lower in the ranking more highly
 than MAP.
 We report the evaluation metrics on the top 1000 results.

Experimental Results for QE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Query Expansion Baselines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the general Rocchio approach for QE, we included two other
 patent specific QE methods as baselines.
 Motivated by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mahdabi2013"

\end_inset

, we used the text definitions of the International Patent Classification
 (IPC) codes assigned to a patent application as a source for query expansion
 --- this is denoted as 
\series bold
IPC Codes
\series default
.
 We also implemented the QE approach proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2011"

\end_inset

, which automatically generates candidate synonyms sets (SynSet) for terms,
 and use it as a source of expansion terms.
 This approach has two variants: (i) The first one use the probability associate
d with the SynSet entries as a weight for each expanded term in the query
 (denoted 
\series bold
WSynSet
\series default
).
 Therefore, each term was replaced with its SynSet entries with the probability
 of each item in the SynSet acting as a weight to the term within the query.
 (ii) The second one neglected this associated probability and used uniform
 weighting for all synonyms of a given term (denoted 
\series bold
USynSet
\series default
).
 The combination of QE methods, relevance model and term selection options
 give us seven QE algorithms to evaluate.
 When MMRQE is used in combination with the VSM, the additional terms use
 the weights provided by the Rocchio method, whereas when using MMRQE and
 Rocchio with BM25, there is no need to weight the terms.
 For all methods, their parameters were fixed to their optimal values, which
 were estimated using the CLEF-IP training queries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other QE methods have been also explored for patent prior art search.
 For example, Magdy et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2011"

\end_inset

 experiment a set of classic techniques of query expansion, which rely WordNet
 as source of expansion terms.
 However, none of these approaches were able to achieve a significant improvemen
t over the baseline/queries without expansion.
 Also, Bashir et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bashir2010"

\end_inset

 propose a query expansion with pseudo-relevance feedback.
 They proposed to select relevant terms for the expansion process using
 a machine learning approach, by picking terms that may have a potential
 positive impact on the retrieval effectiveness.
 However, this approach can be computational expensive, since the presented
 features are complicated to compute.
 Verma and Varma 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Verma2011"

\end_inset

 propose a different approach, which instead of using the patent text to
 query, they use its International Patent Classification (IPC) codes as
 query which are expanded using the citation network.
 The formed query is used to perform an initial search.
 The results are then re-ranked using queries constructed from patent text.
 Throughout our experiments, we concluded that relying on other terms to
 form a query rather than those in the patent application, leads to poor
 retrieval quality.
 Therefore, the approach proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Verma2011"

\end_inset

 doesn't guarantee to obtain good performance.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Lastly, a more recent work by Mahdabi et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mahdabi2013"

\end_inset

 propose a query expansion method that build a query-specific patent lexicon
 based on the definitions of the IPC.
 Then, this patent lexicon is used to select expansion terms that are focused
 on the query topic.
 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we discuss the results of the evaluation performed on the
 QE methods described above.
 But before, we first discuss the effect of the size of the PRF set on the
 performance.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tbl:PFRSize"

\end_inset

 shows the impact of the PRF size on the performance for the two QE algorithms
 Rocchio and MMRQE.
 These results are shown on the CLEF-IP 2010 training dataset, which consists
 of 196 topics.
 We observe that the best QE performance results are obtained when using
 few documents in the PRF set as it was also reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2011"

\end_inset

 (in our case, the top five gave the best results).
 This is certainly due to the fact that a large PRF set will include too
 much irrelevant documents, whose the terms may negatively affect the quality
 of the expanded query.

 using no QE, just the baseline retrieval model).
 For lack of space we show only the results of queries extracted from the
 claims and the abstract used as source of query expansion.
 From these results, we make the following observations: (i) for the two
 retrieval models (VSM and BM25), MMRQE provides the best performance for
 both MAP and PRES (except for MAP, where Rocchio BM25 provides better performan
ce than MMRQE BM25), (ii) for both MMRQE and Rocchio, the best performance
 is obtained while adding no more than 50 terms to the original queries
 (adding more terms may have no effect, or decrease the performance), and
 (iii) exploiting external sources for query expansion provides poor performance
 (IPC code definition and SynSets).

\end_inset

 show the performance obtained for all the QE methods, while selecting the
 optimal number of terms used for the expansion (number of terms that maximizes
 the performance for each method).
 From these results, we first observe that the best section to use for querying
 is the description section (see Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:qDescription-MAP-CLEF-IP2010"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:qDescription-PRES-CLEF-IP2010"

\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:qDescription-PRES-CLEF-IP2011"

\end_inset

).
 We attribute this to the fact that the description section has more content
 along with relevant terms that define the invention since a detailed summary
 of the invention is described therein.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to our experiments, the best source for query expansion is the
 claims section.
 We attribute this to the fact that, the claims contained not only relevant,
 but also, specific terminology, since the scope of the invention is described
 therein.
 However, when querying using the claims, other sources of query expansion
 provided better performance.
 This may be because claims are very similar between them and contained
 specific terms; consequently, the queries lack of diversity and general
 terms or synonyms that are used to describe similar inventions.
 It is interesting to notice that the description is not either a good source
 for expansion, since its content is too broad, therefore, it contains many
 irrelevant terms that hurt the performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As expected, we observed that query expansion is not useful for very long
 queries (i.e.
 description), indicating that in advanced stages of the patent application
 process, QE is not relevant.
 We also notice that when dealing with more mid-long queries such as abstract
 or claims, MMRQE is more effective than Rocchio, which suggest that diverse
 term selection is not crucial for short queries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that using the IPC code definitions (as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mahdabi2013"

\end_inset

) and SynSet (method of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2011"

\end_inset

) as a source of expansion, gave poor performance (see IPC Codes and SynSet
 bars along the Figures).

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the best term selection method, we conclude that in general MMRQE
 provides better performance than Rocchio.
 To give an insight of the effect of MMRQE and Rocchio over the performance,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tbl:QESampleQueries"

\end_inset

 shows some queries where QE methods improved the performance.
 First of all, it is interesting to notice that even if there are common
 terms selected to expand the queries by both MMRQE and Rocchio, the lists
 of MMRQE contain more diversified terms (at least in the two first examples).
 For the two first examples, relevant patents talk about a similar idea
 than the applications, but using different examples and applications (the
 writers of a patent use complex and ambiguous terms to generalize the coverage
 of the invention).
 Hence, for the first query, key terms like: 
\shape italic
rotor, blend, and suction
\shape default
, were able to capture the scope of the relevant patents to allow either
 retrieving them (improving PRES), or pushing them to the top of the ranking
 (improving MAP).
 As for the third query, MMRQE expand the query with general terms, e.g.
 
\shape italic
result, includ, extend, plural
\shape default
, which probably encourage retrieving irrelevant patents.

 An article of manufacture having a nominal profile substantially in accordance
 with Cartesian coordinate values of X, Y and Z set forth in a TABLE 1.
 Wherein X and Y are distances in inches which, when connected by smooth
 continuing arcs, define airfoil profile sections at each distance Z in
 inches.
 The profile sections at the Z distances being joined smoothly with one
 another to form a complete airfoil shape (22,23).

Abstract:
\series default
 It is intended to provide a crosslinked polyrotaxane formed by crosslinking
 polyrotaxane moleculesvia chemical bonds which exhibits excellent optical
 properties in water or in an aqueous solution of sodium chloride; a compound
 having this crosslinked polyrotaxane; and a process for producing the same.
 The above object can be achieved by a crosslinked polyrotaxane having at
 least two polyrotaxane molecules, wherein linear molecules are included
 in a skewered-like state at the opening of cyclodextrin molecules and blocking
 groups are provided at both ends of the linear molecules, so as to prevent
 the cyclodextrin molecules from leaving, and cyclodextrin molecules in
 at least two polyrotaxane molecules being bonded to each other via chemical
 bond, characterized in that hydroxyl (-OH) groups in the cyclodextrin molecules
 are partly substituted with non-ionic groups.

Abstract:
\series default
 The fire-rated recessed downlight includes a mantle.
 A radiating mouth (4) is defined in the mantle.
 A dilatable fireproof piece (5) is fixed in the radiating mouth (4).
 Radiating apertures (6 or 6') corresponding to the radiating mouth (4)
 is defined in the dilatable fireproof piece (5) or between edges of the
 dilatable fireproof piece (5) and edges of the radiating mouth (4).
 The radiating mouth (4) of the mantle and the dilatable fireproof piece
 (5) could help to radiate the heat in ordinary situation and the dilatable
 fireproof piece (5) will expand rapidly to close the radiating mouth (4)
 when on fire, therefore the fire inside the mantle will not spread to the
 outside.

Experimental Results for QR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Query Reduction Baselines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a general QR method, we proposed to adapt the Rocchio method for query
 pruning.
 Basically, the idea is once we have computed the Rocchio modified query
 vector, we take only terms of the initial query that appear in this vector
 and rank them using the Rocchio score.
 Then, we remove 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 terms with the lower score.
 We refer to this approach as 
\series bold
RocchioQR
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding patent specific QR methods, we implemented the approach proposed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ganguly2011"

\end_inset

.
 This technique decomposes a query (a patent section) into constituent text
 segments and computes the Language Modeling (LM) similarities by calculating
 the probability of generating each segment from the top ranked documents
 (PRF set).
 Then, the query is reduced by removing the least similar segments from
 the query.
 This approach is denoted 
\series bold
LMQR
\series default
.
 Finally, we also proposed a baseline method that use IPC codes for query
 reduction as follows: (i) For each patent application, we take the definitions
 of the IPC codes which are associated to it.
 Then, (ii) we rank the terms of the query according to both their frequency
 in the class code definition, and their frequency in the query.
 Finally, (iii) we remove bottom terms of this ranking from the query (i.e.
 good terms are terms that occur a lot in the query, and few in the class
 code definition, whereas bad terms are those that occur few in the query,
 and a lot in the class code definition).
 The intuition is that, terms in the IPC code definition may represent "stopword
s", especially if they are rare (infrequent in the patent application).
 We denote this approach 
\series bold
IPC Codes
\series default
.
 The combination of QR method with the relevance model and term selection
 options gives us eight QR algorithms to evaluate.
 Again, the parameters of all methods were fixed to their optimal values,
 which were estimated using the CLEF-IP training queries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mahdabi2013"

\end_inset

 proposed as reduction process to short the query by taking only the first
 claim of a patent application since it contains the core of the invention.
 This approach has not been implemented as its authors already point out
 its poor performance.

 Reproducibility of search means that the retrieval system will give the
 same results for the same query each time.
 Hence, Kim et al.
 
\backslash

 decision trees learned from pseudo-labeled documents and rank the suggested
 queries using query quality predictors.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we discuss the results of the evaluation performed on the
 QR methods described above.
 As recommended in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ganguly2011"

\end_inset

 and confirmed in our own experimentation (not shown due to lack of space),
 best QR performance results are also obtained when using few documents
 in the PRF set (in our case, the top five gave the best results).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:DivImpactMMRQR"

\end_inset

 shows the impact of the diversity parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 on the performance of MMRQR.
 The results are shown using BM25 retrieval model, and using abstract and
 claims for querying.
 Throughout our experiments, we concluded that the best value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is 0.8, which indicates that few diversification in term selection can provide
 some improvement.
 It is clear that if we consider only diversification to select terms (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

), the overall performance are significantly degraded.
 This is certainly due to the fact that if we consider only diversified
 terms in the query, there is a loss in the meaning of the query, and thus,
 we increase the probability of retrieving irrelevant patents.

 on the x-axis (with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

 using no QR, just the baseline retrieval model).
 For lack of space we show only the results of queries extracted from the
 description.
 These results tell us mainly two things: (i) for the two retrieval models,
 MMRQR provides the best performance for both MAP and PRES, and (ii) for
 almost all methods, the best performance is obtained when removing about
 30 terms from the original queries (in the case where the description is
 used for querying).
 Removing more terms will decrease significantly the performance.

\begin_layout Standard

 show the performance obtained for all the QR methods, when selecting the
 optimal number of terms removed from the original queries (number of terms
 removed that maximizes the performance for each method).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From these results, we make the following observations: (i) query reduction
 is very often not useful for short queries (i.e.
 title), since no QR method outperforms significantly the baseline (i.e.
 No QR), (ii) when dealing with very long query (i.e.
 description), BM25 based QR methods perform better than VSM based QR methods,
 and (iii) in general, MMRQR provides better performance than the other
 methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To give an insight of the effect of MMRQR and LMQR over the performance,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tbl:QRSampleQueries"

\end_inset

 shows some queries where QR methods are helpful.
 First, we notice that even if there is common terms removed from the original
 queries by both MMRQR and LMQR, the lists of MMRQR contain more similar
 terms (e.g.
 
\shape italic
laser, light, interferometer
\shape default
 for the first example).
 For the two first examples, for MMRQR, similar terms were removed from
 the queries, which favor finding more diverse patent relevant to the patent
 applications.
 However, for the third query, MMRQR removed the main terms from the query
 (
\shape italic
motor
\shape default
, and thermal 
\shape italic
load
\shape default
), which likely decrease the quality of the query.

Abstract:
\series default
 Measurements of an interferometric measurement system are corrected for
 variations of atmospheric conditions such as pressure, temperature and
 turbulence using measurements from a second harmonic interferometer (10).
 A ramp, representing the dependence of the SHI data on path length, is
 removed before use of the SHI data.
 The SHI may use a passive Q-switched laser (11) as a light source and Brewster
 prisms (142,144) in the receiver module.
 Optical fibers may be used to conduct light to the detectors (145-147).
 A mirror reflecting the measurement beams has a coating of a thickness
 selected to minimize the sensitivity of the SHI data to changes in coating
 thickness.

Abstract:

 In methods for recovering and recycling helium and unreacted chlorine from
 a process for manufacturing optical fiber an exhaust gas is recovered typically
 from a consolidation furnace and is separated into helium-rich and chlorine-ric
h gas streams.
 The helium-rich stream is typically dried and blended with make-up helium
 and the chlorine-rich stream is typically purified and blended with make-up
 chlorine so that both may be reused in the optical fiber production process.

Abstract:
\series default
 An air conditioner for air conditioning the interior of a compartment includes
 a compressor (C) and an electric motor (84).
 The compressor (C) compresses refrigerant gas and changes the displacement.
 The electric motor (84) drives the compressor (C).
 A motor controller (72) rotates the motor (84) at a constant reference
 speed.
 A detection device (92) detects information related to the thermal load
 on the air conditioner.
 A current sensor (97) detects the value of current supplied to the electric
 motor.
 A controller (72) controls the compressor based on the detected thermal
 load information and the detected current value.
 The controller (72) computes a target torque of the compressor based on
 the thermal load information.
 In accordance with the computed target torque, the controller (72) computes
 a target current value to be supplied to the electric motor.
 The controller (72) further controls the displacement of the compressor
 such that the detected current value matches the target current value.

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper we analyzed general and specific QE and QR methods for patent
 prior art search for partial (incomplete) patent applications on two patent
 retrieval corpora, namely CLEF-IP 2010 and CLEF-IP 2011.
 We demonstrated that QE methods are critical for short queries, i.e.
 title, abstract, and claims, but useless for very long queries, i.e.
 the description section.
 We also showed that claims is the best section that works with QE both
 to query with and to use as a source of query expansion terms, suggesting
 that claims should be written at early stages of the patent application
 drafting so that they can be use to performed patent prior art search.
 We also demonstrate that the novel MMRQE method improves QE results in
 many cases.
 Future work can look at more patent-specific methods of QE for prior art
 search with partial patent applications and how they can be integrated
 with methods like MMRQE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding QR methods, we showed that these techniques are effective to some
 extent for claims and description sections, which are considered the longest
 sections in a patent application.
 We also demonstrated that our new QR method MMRQR improve both recall and
 precision in many cases.
 Future work may consist of exploiting query quality predictors to identify
 useless terms in a query using machine learning methods.
