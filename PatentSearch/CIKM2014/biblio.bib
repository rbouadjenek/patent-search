  abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for the construction of a patent
	test collection for the task of prior art search. Key to the justification
	of the methodology is an analysis of the nature and structure of
	patent documents and the patenting process. These factors enable
	a corpus of patent documents to be reverse engineered in order to
	arrive at high quality, realistic, relevance assessments. The paper
	first outlines the case for such a prior art search test collection
	along with the characteristics of patent documents, before describing
	the proposed method. Further research and development will be directed
	towards the application of this methodology to create a suite of
	prior art search topics for the evaluation of patent retrieval systems.
	We also include a preliminary analysis of its application on European
	patents.},

  abstract = {{This paper examines statistical techniques for exploiting relevance
	information to weight search terms. These techniques are presented
	as a natural extension of weighting methods using information about
	the distribution of index terms in documents in general. A series
	of relevance weighting functions is derived and is justified by theoretical
	considerations. In particular, it is shown that specific weighted
	search methods are implied by a general probabilistic theory of retrieval.
	Different applications of relevance weighting are illustrated by
	experimental results for test collections.}},
