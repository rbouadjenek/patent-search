%Upon the accomplishment of this thesis, I would like to thank various people: 
%professors, colleagues, researchers, and friends. First, I would like express my gratitude to the main director of this research: Scott Sanner. I have been quite fortunate to work on another research advised by him before he leaves NICTA/ANU to Oregon State University. In my weekly meetings and Scott's reading group, I learned  (1) to work hard, but with enthusiasm, (2) to feel responsibility to the contribution we make to the science, (3) to be an independent and efficient thinker (4)  to collaborate with other researchers, and (5) to deal with a research problem by proposing to-the-point research questions and brave enough to examine new ideas and possible solutions. I hope I have learned enough to continue my academic career without his ultimate and unselfish support. I believe that the science world needs more people like Scott. The next scientist who I owe a debt of gratitude to is Bob Williams --- the leader of the Machine Learning group of NICTA. He created such a positive research atmosphere with a collection of excellent researchers at NICTA, which made my tenure at NICTA a fruitful experience.
%I also thank my other committee members, Tom Gedeon, Gabriela Ferraro, and Hanna Suominen for their supports over the course of my MPhil.

%During my one-year MPhil program, I met many successful IR researchers like Paul Thomas (and his IR \& friends seminars), Milad Shokuhi, and Leif Azzopardi who left a strong impact on my career. I would also thank David Hawking for his comments on my work. Dave and Scott's support encouraged me to have a submission to SIGIR, which got accepted $\ddot\smile$. 
%I appreciate Reda Bouadjenek, for his contribution to the baseline IR framework, as well Ehsan, for patiently answering my technical questions (Of course, Scott taught me a valuable lesson, which will be with me forever: "Google is your best friend!" $\ddot\smile$).
%
%And finally, I am grateful to all of my family and friends for being there for me whenever I needed. An special thanks to my dearest Ali for always being my main support after my parents and respecting my attempts to follow my goals and values.
