In the third approach, query terms, which are frequent in query but rare in the collection are selected.
Identifying useful query terms and giving them higher weight is important to build an effective query. The simplest proposed approach was weighting terms in the query based on their perceived significance in the target corpus, combined with their significance in the query~\citep{itoh2003term}. The problem with their method was that they did not take into account the fact that some terms, while being important to the definition of the request for information, may not necessarily appear in the target set at all. For query term selection purposes, it would seem more useful to weight them based only on the genre to which the query belongs, rather than the genre of the target collection. The enhanced version of selecting the most discriminative terms for each topic patent is to compute Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the language model of the query and the whole collection:
%\[ 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:kld}
 KLD(P_{Q}(t)||P_{C}(t)) = P_{Q}(t)log(\frac{P_{Q}(t)}{P_{C}(t)})  
\end{equation}
% \tag{2-1}\label{eq:kld}
% \]
where, $ P_{Q} $ is the probability of each term $ t $ within the patent topic $ q $, and $ P_{C} $ is the probability of the same term $ t $ within the whole collection. 
By applying the Equation~\ref{eq:kld}, it is possible to rank all the terms from the patent topic according to their importance within the query. After ranking the terms by their divergence, only terms with divergence above an specific threshold are selected. Thus, we can build queries that contain the most discriminative terms in different fields of query, which appear frequently in the query, but not so frequently in the collection. So, it helps to retrieve the most relevant patents to a given topic~\citep{perez2010using}. It is possible to exploit the knowledge of IPC meta-data into the query model~\citep{mahdabi2011building}:
%\[ 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:IPCmodel}
 P_{Q}(t) = \lambda\frac{TF(t,Q)}{|Q|}+\frac{(1-\lambda)}{N}\sum_{d\in IPC_{Q}}\frac{TF(t,D)}{|D|}  
\end{equation}
 %\tag{2-2}\label{eq:IPCmodel}
% \]
where, $ TF(t,Q) $ is the term frequency of the term $ t $ in the query patent document, $ |Q| $ is the length of the query patent, $ N $ is the size of the relevant cluster with the same IPC code as the query, and $ \lambda $ is the smoothing parameter.
%\item Used patent structure, linguistic clues, and word relations to identify important terms. Showed that keyword dependency relation
%approach achieved 13-18\% improvement in MAP over the traditional tf-idf based term weighting method when a single field is used for query formulation. Obtained 42-46\% improvement in MAP when used additional terms through pattern-based semantic tagging.~\citep{nguyen2012query}
