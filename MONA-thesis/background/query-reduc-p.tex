In patent prior art search, a query is as long as a patent document; verbose patent queries are not focused on information needed by the user and they may cover more than one topic. Query reduction is a good solution for this problem. We discuss query reduction techniques for patent retrieval as follows:
\\\\
\textbf{Query Segmentation:} 
\ \\
Decomposing each patent query into coherent sub-topics segments --- using TextTiling~\citep{hearst1997texttiling} --- is a solution to make long ambiguous queries focused on the information need. Sub-topic segments can be used as separate queries (query stream) for initial retrieval, then the retrieval results from each of the individual streams are merged to construct the final ranked list for the whole original query. Using each sub-topic as a query stream enables a retrieval model to retrieve related documents from the collection in a more precise way and also allow the PRF algorithm to work on a more focused set of pseudo-relevant documents~\citep{takaki2004associative, ganguly2011united}. In another approach, PRF is adapted for query reduction by decomposing a patent application into constituent text segments and the LM similarities is computed by calculating the probability of generating each segment from the top ranked documents. The least similar segments to the query are removed, hypothesizing that the removal of segments most dissimilar to the pseudo-relevant documents can increase the precision of retrieval by removing non-useful context, while still retaining the useful context to achieve high recall as well~\citep{ganguly2011patent}.
\\\\
\textbf{Query Summarisation:} 
\ \\
This approach assumes that the patent summary (using TextTiling) reflects the main topic as well as the subtopics of a patent document in a concise manner. The LM for the query, collection, and each summary is generated after summarising the patent query~\citep{mahdabi2011report}.

\textbf{Query Term Selection:}
