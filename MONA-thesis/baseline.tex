\label{cha:BaselineIRFramework}
In this chapter, first, we briefly explain our baseline system and the experimental settings; 
then we describe the data collection used in our experiments (i.e., CLEF-IP~2010). In addition, we analyse two main errors caused by the data curation and our experimental~settings.

\section{Errors Caused by Baseline Settings}
Data curation and IPC filter used in baseline settings are two sources of errors;
in this section, we will discuss these two origins of the errors.

\section{Summary}

%\input{baseline/summary}
We explained settings and development of our baseline system 
as well data collection we used in our experiments. We found 
that two sources of errors caused by data curation and using 
IPC filter in our experimental settings. 
 However, we showed that these errors are not the 
main causes of low effective retrieval. Hence, in next chapter, 
we focus on term matching analysis for a patent query and its retrieved 
documents to figure out the main reasons that generic IR techniques fail 
for patent prior art search (i.e., the reasons, which are not specific to our data 
collection or experimental~settings).
