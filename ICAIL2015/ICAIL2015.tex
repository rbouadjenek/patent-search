Patents are used by legal entities to legally protect their inventions
and represent a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing and litigation.
In 2013, 302,948 patent applications were approved in the US alone
-- a number that has doubled in the past 15 years and which makes
prior art search a daunting, but necessary task in the patent application
process. In this work, we seek to investigate the efficacy of prior
art search strategies from the perspective of the inventor who wishes
to assess the patentability of their ideas prior to writing a full
application. While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation
framework of the CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners
in assessing prior art for complete patent applications, less of this
work has focused on patent search with queries representing partial
applications. In the (partial) patent search setting, a query is often
much longer than in other standard IR tasks, e.g., the description
section may contain hundreds or even thousands of words. While the
length of such queries may suggest query reduction strategies to remove
irrelevant terms, intentional obfuscation and general language used
in patents suggests that it may help to expand queries with additionally
relevant terms. To assess the trade-offs among all of these pre-application
prior art search strategies, we comparatively evaluate a variety of
partial application search and query reformulation methods. Among
numerous findings, querying with a full description, perhaps in conjunction
with generic (non-patent specific) query reduction methods, is recommended
for best performance. However, we also find that querying with an
abstract represents the best trade-off in terms of writing effort
vs. retrieval efficacy (i.e., querying with the description sections
only lead to marginal improvements) and that for such relatively short
queries, generic query expansion methods help. %This has led the research to focus on query%reformulation for patent search.  In this paper, we carry out an%intensive study of both patent-specific and standard query%reformulation methods for patent prior art search with partial patent%applications.

\section{Introduction}

\noindent Patents are used by legal entities to legally protect their
inventions and represent a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing
and litigation. In 2013, 302,948 patent applications were approved
in the US alone%
\footnote{http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/ us\_stat.htm%
}, a number that has doubled in the past 15 years. Given that a single
existing patent may invalidate a new patent application, helping inventors
assess the patentability of an idea through a patent prior art search
before writing a complete patent application is an important task.

Patent prior art search involves finding previously granted patents
that may be relevant to a new patent application. The objective and
challenges of standard formulations of patent prior art search are
different from those of standard text and web search since \cite{Magdy2012}:
(i) queries are (partial) patent applications, which consist of documents
with hundreds or thousands of words organized into several sections,
while typical queries in text and web search constitute only a few
words; and (ii) patent prior art search is a recall-oriented task,
where the primary focus is to retrieve all relevant documents at early
ranks, in contrast to text and web search that are precision-oriented,
where the primary goal is to retrieve a subset of documents that satisfy
the query intent. Another important characteristic of patent prior
art search is that, in contrast to scientific and technical writers,
patent writers tend to generalize and maximize the scope of what is
protected {\color{red} by a patent and potentially discourage further innovation by third parties, which further complicates the task of formulating
effective queries. For instance, abstract and vague terms are sometimes pre-referred to concrete ones, i.e., recording means vs. recording apparatus; resources vs. battery life; machines located at point of sale locations vs. vending machines, etc.}

While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework
of the CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in
assessing prior art for complete patent applications, less work has
focused on assessing the patentability of inventions before writing
a full patent application. Furthermore, prior art search with queries
that represent unfinished patent applications is generally desirable,
since writing a full application is time-consuming and costly, especially
if lawyers are hired to assist. Hence, in this paper we consider only
sections which are more likely to be written by the inventor namely
the title, the abstract, and the description section, while we consider
the claims section to be more likely to be written by a patent attorney.

%However prior art search with partial applications is much different than queries with a full application -- namely because the queries are much shorter and represent only parts of a patent application.

%NOTE: start a paragaph with the key idea%A patent application is organized in, at least, four sections: title,%abstract, claims and description. We assumed that a partial application%consist in one of the mentioned sections.

\end{figure*}




To assess the difficulty of querying with partial patent applications,
we refer to Figure \ref{fig:FailureAnalysis}. Here we show an analysis
of the average Jaccard similarity%
\footnote{The Jaccard similarity is used to measure the term overlap between
two sets. Before applying the Jaccard similarity, patent-specific
stopwords were removed, as suggested by \cite{Mahdabi2012}.%
} between different queries (representing the title, abstract, or descriptions
of partial patent applications) and the labeled relevant (all) and
irrelevant documents (top 10 irrelevant documents ranked by BM25 \cite{Robertson1993}).
We show results for the top 100 and bottom 100 queries (100 queries
that perform the best, and 100 queries that perform the worst) of
CLEP-IP 2010 evaluated according to Mean Average Precision (MAP).
Note that while the title section is usually composed of an average
of six terms, the other sections are longer, ranging from ten to
thousands of terms. There are three notable trends here: (i) term
overlap increases from title to description since the query size grows
accordingly; (ii) the bottom 100 performing queries tend to have much
smaller term overlap with the relevant documents than the top 100
queries; and (iii) even in the best case of querying with very long
description sections, the average term overlap indicates many terms
of relevant documents are not found in the query.

%**Highly redundant with above content**%While these results suggest the description section is the best part%of a partial patent application to use as query, they also point out%that the term overlap between the queries and the relevant documents%can be very low. Also, in this context, a query is much longer than%in other standard IR tasks. It can take the form of a long paragraph%(e.g. the case of the abstract used for querying), or even a very%long document (e.g. the case of claims or the description used for%querying). 

Similar observations in the general patent prior art search literature
\cite{Magdy2011} have led to a research focus on query reformulation.
Therefore, we suggest an investigation of \emph{query reformulation}
\cite{Baeza-Yates2010} methods as a means for improving the term
overlap between queries that represent partial patent applications
and relevant documents, with the objective of assessing not only the
performance of standard query reformulation methods, but also the
effectiveness of query reformulation methods that exploit patent-specific
characteristics.

In summary, to aid the patent inventor in developing an effective
pre-application prior art search strategy, we seek to answer the following
questions:
%in this work: 
\begin{itemize}
\item What parts of a patent application should a patent inventor write
first to achieve effective prior art search? What are the trade-offs
in section writing effort vs. the retrieval performance of querying
with that section? 
\item In query expansion, which patent section is the better source for term expansion?
%do any sections of patents serve as better sources of expansion terms? 
Which expansion methods work best, and in which
settings? 
\item For query reformulation (both query expansion and reduction), which
methods work best, and in which settings? Do patent-specific reformulation
methods offer advantages over more generic IR reformulation methods? 
\end{itemize}
To answer these questions, we perform a thorough comparative analysis
of partial patent application query strategies and reformulation methods
on the CLEF-IP patent prior art search datasets.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section \ref{sec:QueryReformulation},
we present a variety of generic and patent-specific query reformulation
methods; in Section \ref{sec:Evaluation}, we present the evaluation
results and analysis to answer the above questions; and in Section
\ref{sec:Conclusion}, we conclude with key observations from this
evaluation that lead to concrete recommendations for patent prior
art search with partial applications.


\section{Query Reformulation for Patents}

\label{sec:QueryReformulation}

Query Reformulation is the process of transforming an initial query
$Q$ to another query $Q'$. This transformation may be either an
expansion or a reduction of the query.\emph{ Query Expansion} (QE)
\cite{Efthimiadis1996} enhances the query with additional terms likely
to occur in relevant documents. Hence, given a query representation
$Q$, QE aims to select an optimal subset $T_{k}$ of $k$ terms,
which are relevant to $Q$, then build $Q'$ such as $Q'=Q\cup T_{k}$.
As for \emph{Query Reduction} (QR) \cite{Kumaran2009}, it is the
process that reduces the query such that superfluous information is
removed. Hence, given a query representation $Q$, QR aims to select
an optimal subset $T_{k}\subset Q$ of $k$ terms, which are relevant
to $Q$, then build $Q'$ such as $Q'=T_{k}$.

The outline of the following subsections is as follows: 
Section \ref{sec:UtilityQR} motivates query reduction for patent prior art search. 
Then, we describe the standard and patent-specific query reformulation
methods that we evaluate in Section \ref{sec:Evaluation}. Finally,
in Section \ref{sec:FurtherAfield} we provide a brief description
of other patent-specific query reformulation methods, which are not
considered in this paper.

%In the following subsections, we first give a motivation behind using query reduction for patent search in Section \ref{sec:UtilityQR}.

\subsection{Utility of Query Reduction for Patents}

\label{sec:UtilityQR}

While the title is usually composed by an average of six terms, the
other sections are longer, ranging from ten to thousands of terms.
Therefore, we investigate the impact of query reduction methods only
when querying with long sections such as abstract or description.

Table \ref{tbl:queryPAC-1019} provides insight into the utility of
query reduction for the abstract section of the Topic PAC-1019 from
the CLEF-IP 2010 data collection. The baseline query, which is the
original query (provided in the header row) after stemming and patent
specific stopword removal, had an Average Precision (AP) of 0.280
and a Patent Retrieval Evaluation Score (PRES) \cite{Magdy2010a} {\color{red} define PRES here, maybe a footnote is enough!!}
of 0.777 (its performance are provided in the footer row). We show
the evaluation performance of the query after removing each term from
the original query. The removed terms have been sorted in the order
of decreasing PRES. We can observe that there are ten terms (highlighted
in boldface) that if they are (individually) removed from the query,
we increase PRES of the original long query.

{\color{red} the highlighting is confusing because the terms are not in boldface but the scores are, maybe highlight both!!}

Figure \ref{fig:QRUtility} shows the summary upper-bound performance
for precision, recall, MAP, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and PRES that
can be achieved for a set of 1304 abstract queries from the CLEF-IP
2010 data collection. ``Baseline\textquotedblright{} refers to a
probabilistic BM25 retrieval model \cite{Robertson1993} run using
the Lucene search engine \cite{McCandless2010} and the original long
query. ``Oracle\textquotedblright{} refers to the situation where
all terms with negative impact are removed from the original long
query following the previous process. This gives us an upper bound
on the performance that can be realized through query reduction for
this set of queries. It is this statistically significant improvement
in performance through query reduction that we can target for the
abstract and the description sections.

\subsection{Generic Query Reformulation Methods}

\label{sec:StandardQRMethods}

\subfour{The Rocchio Algorithm for Relevance Feedback:} The Rocchio
algorithm \cite{Salton1971} is a classic algorithm of relevance feedback
used mainly for query expansion. In brief, it provides a method of
incorporating relevance feedback information into the vector space
model representing a query \cite{Manning2008}. The underlying theory
behind Rocchio is to find a query vector $\overrightarrow{Q'}$, that
maximizes similarity with relevant documents while minimizing similarity
with irrelevant documents. Typically, a pseudo-relevance feedback
(PRF) set of $k$ top ranked documents obtained after an initial run
of the query is considered as the set of relevant documents to build
$\overrightarrow{Q'}$. We refer to this method as RocchioQE.%
\footnote{We used the LucQE module, which provides an implementation of the
Rocchio method for Lucene. \texttt{http://lucene-qe.sourceforge.net/}%
}

Similarly, Rocchio can be used as a QR method. Basically, the idea
is that once the Rocchio-modified query vector has been computed,
it is possible to select only the terms that appear in the initial
query $Q$ and rank them using the Rocchio score and finally, select
the top $k$ terms with the highest score to build $Q'$. We refer
to this approach as RocchioQR.

\subfour{Maximal Marginal Relevance for Query Reformulation:} As
a general method for query reformulation, we also consider a method
of ``diverse'' term selection --- an adaptation of the \emph{Maximal
Marginal Relevance} (MMR) \cite{Carbonell1998} algorithm for result
set diversification. But, rather than use MMR for diverse document
selection (as typically used), it is used here for diverse term selection
--- the hypothesis being that diverse term selection may improve coverage
of relevant terms in the PRF set.

%The idea is to use MMR for diverse term selection. %\subfour{MMR Query Expansion (MMRQE)}%\label{sec:MMRQE}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[!t]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{img/matrix} 
\par\end{centering}

\protect\protect\caption{Notation used in MMR QE/QR.}


\label{fig:Notation} 
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the case of QE, we call this diversified expansion method MMR Query
Expansion (MMRQE). MMRQE takes as input a PRF set, which is used to
build a document-term matrix of $n$ documents and $m$ terms as shown
in Figure \ref{fig:Notation} (the TF-IDF is used to populate the
matrix for each document vector). To represent the query $Q$ in the
documents' dimension as in Figure \ref{fig:Notation}, we use the
BM25 or TF-IDF score between each document $d_{i}$ and the query.
Hence, given a query representation $Q$, MMRQE aims to select an
optimal subset of $k$ terms $T_{k}^{*}\subset D$ (where $|T_{k}^{*}|=k$
and $k\ll|m|$, and $D$ is the PRD set) relevant to $Q$ but inherently
different from each other (i.e., diverse). This can be achieved by
building $T_{k}^{*}$ in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal
term $t_{k}^{*}$ given the previous set of optimal term selections
$T_{k-1}^{*}=\{t_{1}^{*},\ldots,t_{k-1}^{*}\}$ (assuming $T_{0}^{*}=\emptyset$)
using the MMR diverse selection criterion:

\begin{equation}
t_{k}^{*}=\argmax_{t_{k}\notin T_{k-1}^{*}}\hspace{-0.3mm}[\lambda\cos(Q,t_{k})-\hspace{-0.3mm}(1-\lambda)\max_{t_{j}\in T_{k-1}^{*}}\cos(t_{j},t_{k})]\label{eq:MMRQE-QR}
\end{equation}


Here, the first cosine similarity term measures relevance between
the query $Q$ and possible expansion term $t_{k}$ while the second
term penalizes the possible expansion term according to its cosine
similarity with any currently selected term in $T_{k-1}^{*}$. The
parameter $\lambda\in[0,1]$ trades off relevance and diversity. For
MMRQE, we found that $\lambda=0.5$ generally provide the best results,
according to our experiments on the CLEF-IP training dataset collection.

For QR, we can greedily rebuild the query from scratch, while choosing
diversified terms from the query itself. Here, we call this approach
MMR Query Reduction (MMRQR). Formally, given a query representation
$Q$, MMRQR aims to select an optimal subset of $k$ terms $T_{k}^{*}\subset Q$
(where $|T_{k}^{*}|=k$ and $k<|Q|$) relevant to $Q$ but inherently
different from each other (i.e., diverse). This can be achieved by
building $T_{k}^{*}$ in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal
term $t_{k}^{*}$ given the previous set of optimal term selections
$T_{k-1}^{*}=\{t_{1}^{*},\ldots,t_{k-1}^{*}\}$ (assuming $T_{0}^{*}=\emptyset$)
using an adaptation of the MMR diverse selection criterion. Note that
we use all the sections of the patent documents in the PRF set to
built the document-term matrix of $n$ documents and $m$ terms shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:Notation}. For MMRQR, we found that $\lambda=0.8$
generally provide the best results in our experiments on the CLEF-IP
dataset collection.

The key insight we want to highlight is that MMRQE does not select
expansion terms independently as in practical usage of Rocchio, but
rather it selects terms that have uncorrelated usage patterns across
documents, thus hopefully encouraging diverse term selection that
covers more documents for a fixed expansion budget $k$ and ideally,
higher recall.


\subsection{Patent-specific Query Reformulation Methods}

\label{sec:SpecificQRMethods}

%In this section, we first describe two patent-specific query expansionmethods, then, we describe two patent-specific query reduction methods.

\subfour{Synonym Sets for Patent Query Expansion:} Magdy et al.
\cite{Magdy2011} proposed a patent query expansion method, which
automatically generates candidate synonym sets (SynSet) for terms
to use as a source of expansion terms. The idea for generating the
SynSet comes from the characteristics of the CLEF-IP patent collection,
where some of the sections in some patents are translated into three
languages (English, French, and German). They used these parallel
manual translations to create possible synonyms sets. Hence, for a
word $w$ in one language which has possible translations to a set
of words in another language ${w_{1},w_{2},\ldots,w_{n}}$, this set
of words can be considered as synonyms or at least related to each
other. The generated SynSet is used for query expansion in two ways:
(i) The first one used the probability associated with the SynSet
entries as a weight for each expanded term in the query (denoted WSynSet).
Therefore, each term was replaced with its SynSet entries with the
probability of each item in the SynSet acting as a weight to the term
within the query. (ii) The second one neglected this associated probability
and used uniform weighting for all synonyms of a given term (denoted
USynSet).

\subfour{Patent Lexicon for Query Expansion:} Mahdabi et al. \cite{Mahdabi2013}
proposed to build a query-specific patent lexicon based on definitions
of the International Patent Classification (IPC). The lexicon is simply
built by removing general and patent-specific stop-words from the
text of IPC definition pages. Each entry in the lexicon is composed
of a key and a value. The key is an IPC class and the value is a set
of terms representing the mentioned class. Then, the lexicon is used
to extract expansion concepts related to the context of the information
need of a given query patent. To this end, the IPC class of the query
patent is searched in the lexicon and the terms matching this class
are considered as candidate expansion terms. The proposed approach
tries to combine these two complementary vocabularies (i.e. terms
of the query and the IPC codes). Note that all the levels of the IPC
codes are used to build the lexicon. In this paper we refer to this
patent query expansion method as IPC Codes.

\subfour{Language Model for Query Reduction:} In \cite{Ganguly2011},
the authors proposed a query reduction technique, which decomposes
a query (a patent section) into constituent text segments and computes
Language Model (LM) similarities by calculating the probability of
generating each segment from the top ranked documents (PRF set). Then,
the query is reduced by removing the least similar segments from the
query. We refer to this method as LMQR.

\subfour{IPC Codes for Query Reduction:} Based on the intuition
that, terms in the IPC code definition may represent \textquotedbl{}stop-words\textquotedbl{},
especially if they are rare (infrequent in the patent application),
a query can be reduced as follows:
%one can think to reduce a patent query as follows:
(i) For each patent
application, take the definitions of the IPC codes which are associated
to it. Then, (ii) rank the terms of the query according to the difference
in their frequency in the query and their frequency in the class code
definition. Finally, (iii) remove bottom terms of this ranking from
the query (i.e. good terms are terms that occur a lot in the query,
and few in the class code definition, whereas bad terms are those
that occur few in the query, and a lot in the class code definition).
In the evaluation section we denote this approach IPC-StopWords.

\subsection{Further Afield}

\label{sec:FurtherAfield}

{\color{red} not sure is further afield is a correct term to use here, I never see it before in a paper. You can instead put related work!}

We believe the above outlined patent-specific query reformulation
methods circumscribe a range of patent-specific approaches spanning
synonym lexicons, specially derived language models, and IPC code
resources; hence our evaluation supports the objective of identifying
general query reformulation methods from the novel perspective of
partial patent application prior art search that may be deserving
of further investigation in future work.

{\color{red} not sure what you want to say in the above paragraph. 
maybe the second time you mentioned \textbf{patent-specific} you meant  \textbf{general methods}?}

However, some more complex patent-specific methods have also been
explored for general patent prior art search. The scenario of patent
prior art search consists of manually form queries by selecting high
frequency terms from patent application. Hence, in \cite{Itoh2003},
authors proposed a new term selection method using different term
frequencies depending on the genre in the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval
Task.

Also, Xue and Croft \cite{Xue:2009:TPP:1571941.1572139} advocates
the use of the full patent application as the query to reduce the
burden on patent examiners. They conducted a series of experiments
in order to examine the effect of different patent fields, and concludes
with the observation that the best Mean Average Precision (MAP) is
achieved using the text from the description section of the query
patent with raw term frequencies. Also, Fuji \cite{Fujii:2007:EPR:1277741.1277912}
showed that retrieval effectiveness can be improved by combining IR
methods with the result of citation extraction.

Bashir et al. \cite{Bashir2010} propose a query expansion with pseudo-relevance
feedback. Query expansion terms are selected using a using a machine
learning approach, by picking terms that may have a potential positive
impact on the retrieval effectiveness. However, this approach can
be computational expensive, since the presented features are complicated
to compute, e.g. Pair-wise Terms Proximity features. Verma and Varma
\cite{Verma2011} propose a different approach, which instead of using
the patent text to query, use its International Patent Classification
(IPC) codes, which are expanded using the citation network. The formed
query is used to perform an initial search. The results are then re-ranked
using queries constructed from patent text. Throughout our experiments,
we concluded that relying on other terms to form a query rather than
those in the patent application, leads to poor retrieval quality.
Lastly, a more recent work by Mahdabi et al. \cite{Mahdabi:2014:PQF:2684820.2651363}
propose a unified framework for query expansion which incorporates
bibliographic information, IPC classifications, and temporal features
to improve the initial query built from the query patent. They used
the link-based structure of the citation graph together with the term
distribution of cited documents and built a query model from the citation
graph. They used the publication dates associated with the patents
to adapt the query model to the change of vocabulary over time. The
results showed the advantage of using the term distribution of the
cited documents together with the publication dates.

Finally, other works investigated query suggestion for patent prior
art search, which reflect real-life scenario of examiners, who form
reproducible boolean queries \cite{Adams2011,Azzopardi2010,Kim2011}. 

%we do%do not show comparisons with these methods here for the following reasons:%(i) their authors already pointed out their poor performance \cite{Mahdabi2013}; %(ii) as reflected in our existing experiments, patent-specific lexicons%have not tended to yield significantly better query reformulation results%in comparison to generic methods~\cite{Magdy2011,Verma2011}; and %(iii) the method is computational too expensive \cite{Bashir2010}.


\section{Experimental Evaluation}

\label{sec:Evaluation}

In this section we first explain the experimental setup for evaluating
the effectiveness of patent prior art search with partial applications.
Then, we discuss the results of QE and QR methods in Sections \ref{sec:QEResults}
and \ref{sec:QRResults} respectively.


\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\label{sec:Setup}

For our experiments, we used used the Lucene IR System%
\footnote{\texttt{http://lucene.apache.org/}%
} to index the English subset of CLEF-IP 2010 and CLEF-IP 2011 datasets%
\footnote{\texttt{http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/\textasciitilde{}clef-ip/}%
} \cite{Piroi2011,Roda2009} with the default settings for stemming
and stop-word removal. We also removed patent-specific stop-words
as described in \cite{Magdy2012}. CLEF-IP 2010 contains 2.6 million
patent documents, and the English test sets of CLEF-IP 2010 correspond
to 1303 topic sources of partial patent application queries. We also
experimented with the CLEF-IP 2011 dataset.

In our implementation, each section of a patent (title, abstract,
claims, and description) is indexed in a separate field so that different
sections can be used, for example, as source of expansion terms. However,
when a query is processed, all indexed fields are targeted, since
this generally offers best retrieval performance. As suggested in
previous work \cite{Lopez2009,Roda2009} and found to yield best results
in our experiments, we used the patent classification (IPC) codes
assigned to the query topics to filter search results to match at
least one of the query IPC codes.

We report both MAP and PRES (Patent Retrieval Evaluation Score). The
PRES metric places more emphasis on high-recall retrieval by weighting
relevant documents lower in the ranking more highly than MAP. We report
these ranking evaluation metrics on the top 1000 results.


\subsection{Query Expansion Results}

\label{sec:QEResults}

In this section, we discuss the results of partial patent queries
with the QE methods described in Section \ref{sec:QueryReformulation}.
The configuration options and associated questions that were considered are the followings:
%In doing this experimentation, there are many configuration options and associated questions to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Partial patent query type:} We consider a query of a partial
patent application to consist of either the title, the abstract, or
the description section. Recall that we do not consider the Claim section,
since it is more likely to be written by a lawyer than the inventor.
Hence, critical questions are: what part of a partial application
an inventor should write to obtain the best search results? And what
QE methods work best for each type of query? 
\item \textbf{Query expansion source:} We consider the abstract, claims,
and description sections as different term sources to determine which
section offers the best source of expansion terms, e.g., are words
in the claims of particularly high value as expansion terms? We omit
the use of the title as a source of expansion terms noting that this
configuration performed poorly due to the relative sparsity of useful
expansion terms in the titles of the PRF set. 
\item \textbf{Relevance model:} For initial retrieval of documents in the
\emph{pseudo-relevant} feedback set (PRF) and subsequent re-retrieval,
there are various options for the relevance ranking model. In this
work, we explore a probabilistic approach represented by the popular
BM25 \cite{Robertson1993} algorithm, as well as a vector space model
(VSM) approach, TF-IDF \cite{Salton1975}. A natural question is which
relevance model works best for query expansion for patent prior art
search? 
\item \textbf{Term selection method:} We consider the different query expansion
methods described above, i.e. RocchioQE, MMRQE, IPC Codes, WSynSet,
USynSet and ask what is the best QE method for patent search?

To summarize all the results obtained over all the above configurations,
Figures \ref{fig:MAP-CLEF2010}, \ref{fig:PRES-CLEF2010}, \ref{fig:MAP-CLEF2011}
and \ref{fig:PRES-CLEF2011} show the MAP and PRES obtained for all
the QE methods, while selecting the optimal number of terms used for
the expansion (the number of terms that maximizes the performance
for each method). From these results, we make the following observations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The best partial application section to use for querying is the description
section. %(see Figure \ref{fig:qDescription-PRES-CLEF-IP2010}). 
We attribute this to the fact that the description section has more
content along with relevant terms that define the invention since
a detailed summary of the invention is described therein. 
\item However, perhaps a better trade-off in terms of effort vs. retrieval
performance is to query with the abstract. Relative to the description,
it takes much less effort to write the abstract. Further, querying
with the abstract provides a substantial boost in retrieval performance
compared to the title (about 165\% for MAP). In contrast, querying
with the description offer only marginal performance gains (about
10\% to 30\% for MAP) compared to using the abstract. 
\item Query expansion is not useful for very long queries (i.e. description)
since no method outperforms the baseline. This indicates that in advanced
writing stages of the patent preparation process, QE is not useful.% (see Figure
%\ref{fig:qDescription-MAP-CLEF-IP2010} and Figure %\ref{fig:qDescription-PRES-CLEF-IP2010}).
\item {\color{red} As for query expansion, MMRQE is less effective than Rocchio for short queries such as title or abstract, whereas it appears to provide slightly better comparative results for the longer description query. This
suggests diverse term selection may be helpful for long queries. } 

% when dealing with short queries such as the title or abstract, MMRQE is less effective than Rocchio, whereas it appears to provide slightly better comparative results for the longer description query. This suggests diverse term selection may be helpful for long queries. 



%% I don't think the results clearly support the following statements...%% just omit since they aren't crucial for the paper.  -Scott%%%\item The best source for query expansion is the claims section. We%  attribute this to the fact that, the claims contain not only%  relevant, but also, specific terminology, since the scope of the%  invention is described therein. However, when querying using the%  claims, other sources of query expansion provided better%  performance. This may be because claims are very similar between%  them and contained specific terms; consequently, the queries lack of%  diversity and general terms or synonyms that are used to describe%  similar inventions.
\item The description section does not appear to be a good source for expansion,
likely since its content is too broad and it contains many irrelevant
terms. 
\item When dealing with short length queries (i.e., title and abstract),
VSM performs better than BM25, while for very long queries (i.e.,
description), BM25 performs the best. 
\item In general, generic QE methods like Rocchio tend to outperform patent-specific
QE methods, although among patent-specific methods, the IPC Codes
approach seemed to work best. %\item Using the IPC code definitions (as suggested by%  \cite{Mahdabi2013}) and SynSet (method of \cite{Magdy2011}) as a%  source of expansion, gave poor performance (see IPC Codes and SynSet%  bars along the Figures).%\item Finally, regarding the best term selection method, we conclude%  that in general, MMRQE provides the best performance, followed by%  RocchioQE.
\end{enumerate}
To give an insight of the effect of MMRQE and Rocchio over the performance,
Table \ref{tbl:QESampleQueries} shows some queries where QE methods
improved the performance. First of all, it is interesting to notice
that even if there are common terms selected to expand the queries
by both MMRQE and Rocchio, the lists of MMRQE contain more diversified
terms (at least in the two first examples). For the two first examples,
relevant patents talk about a similar idea than the applications,
but using different examples and applications (the writers of a patent
use complex and ambiguous terms to generalize the coverage of the
invention). Hence, for the first query, key terms like: \textit{rotor,
blend, and suction}, were able to capture the scope of the relevant
patents to allow either retrieving them (improving PRES), or pushing
them to the top of the ranking (improving MAP). As for the third query,
MMRQE expand the query with general terms, e.g. \textit{result, includ,
extend, plural}, which probably encourage retrieving irrelevant patents.

\subsection{Query Reduction Results}

\label{sec:QRResults}

Next we discuss the results of the evaluation performed on the QR
methods described in Section \ref{sec:QueryReformulation}. As for
QE, we carry out comprehensive experiments with the following configuration
options and associated questions to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Partial patent query type:} We apply QR methods to a query
of a partial patent application, consisting of the abstract or the
description sections. A critical question is what part of a partial
application is best suited for QR? Note that we consider that there
is no interest in reducing a title query since it already contains
very few terms. 
\item \textbf{Relevance model:} We explore a probabilistic approach represented
by the popular BM25~\cite{Robertson1993} algorithm, as well as a
vector space model (VSM) approach, TF-IDF~\cite{Salton1975}. A natural
question is which relevance model works best for query reduction for
patent prior art search? 
\item \textbf{Term selection method:} We consider the different query reduction
methods described above, i.e. RocchioQR, MMRQR, LMQR, IPC-StopWords
and ask what is the best QR method for patent search? Further, how
do these results compare to QE for the same queries?

To summarize all the results obtained over all the above configurations,
Figures \ref{fig:QR-MAP-CLEF-IP2010}, \ref{fig:QR-PRES-CLEF-IP2010},
\ref{fig:QR-MAP-CLEF-IP2011} and \ref{fig:QR-PRES-CLEF-IP2011} show
the respective MAP and PRES performance obtained for all QR methods,
when selecting the optimal number of terms removed from the original
queries. From these results, we make the following observations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The best performing QR methods show benefits vs. No QR for all queries
(i.e., abstract and description). 
\item The term selection methods that provide the best performance are,
in general, RocchioQR and MMRQR. 
\item When dealing with medium-length queries (i.e., abstract), VSM performs
better than BM25, while for very long queries (i.e., description),
BM25-based QR methods perform better than VSM-based QR methods. 
\item In comparison to the MAP and PRES results for QE from Figure \ref{fig:MAP-CLEF2010}
and Figure \ref{fig:PRES-CLEF2010}, the best QE and QR methods perform
comparably for abstract queries, whereas for description queries,
the best QR method slightly outperforms the best QE method and No
QR. Hence, the best overall retrieval result in this work in terms
of both MAP and PRES comes from a description query with a generic
(non-patent specific) QR method.

Finally, to give an insight of the effect of MMRQR and LMQR over the
performance, Table \ref{tbl:QRSampleQueries} shows some queries where
QR methods are helpful. First, we notice that even if there are common
terms removed from the original queries by both MMRQR and LMQR, the
lists of MMRQR contain more similar terms (e.g. \textit{laser, light,
interferometer} for the first example). For the two first examples,
for MMRQR, similar terms were removed from the queries, which favor
finding more diverse patent relevant to the patent applications. However,
for the third query, MMRQR removed the main terms from the query (\textit{motor},
and thermal \textit{load}), which likely decrease the quality of the
query.

{\color{red} NOT CLEAR FOR ME, MAYBE YOU DID WANT TO SAY THE FOLLOWING? First, we notice that even there are common
terms removed from the original queries by both MMRQR and LMQR, the
terms removed by MMRQR tend to be similar between them (e.g., \textit{laser, light, interferometer}, in 1-Topic) which favour
finding diverse relevant terms to the patent applications. However,
for the 3-Topic, MMRQR removed the main terms from the query (\textit{motor},
and thermal \textit{load}), which likely decrease the quality of the
query.}

\section{Conclusions}

\label{sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, we analyzed various query strategies for patent prior
art search with partial (incomplete) applications along with generic
and patent-specific query reformulation (expansion and reduction)
methods. We performed a comprehensive comparative evaluation of these
methods on the CLEF-IP patent corpus for prior art search.

We showed that the description is the best partial application section
to query with, followed by the the abstract, and lastly the title
section. However, the largest boost in performance (about 165\% for
MAP) comes when switching from a title query to an abstract query;
smaller relative boosts are given by querying instead with the description
(about 10\% to 30\% for MAP). This is a critical insight since it
is substantially easier for the patent inventor to draft an abstract
rather than a full patent description and in doing so, still manage
to retrieve the majority of prior art that would have been retrieved
with the full description.

We observed that query expansion (QE) methods are useful for short
to medium length queries (i.e., title and abstract), but useless for
very long queries (i.e., the description section). We also showed
that the description section does not provide the best source of expansion
terms for QE, rather the abstract tend to offer better candidate terms
for QE. In the same vein, we also found traditional IR methods like
Rocchio or variations to work just as well for QE (and generally better)
in comparison with patent-specific methods that used specialized expansion
sources such as synonym lexicons or IPC code definitions. %For QE, future work should investigate how can we exploit patent-specific%meta-data such as inventor and citation networks to better exploit%specialized domains of discourse relevant to patent subfields.

Regarding query reduction (QR) methods, we showed these techniques
are generally most effective compared to QE for the description section
(the longest section used as a partial application query). Albeit
by a slim margin over No QR, the overall best retrieval performance
results in this work are achieved with generic (non-patent specific)
QR methods for description queries.

%Finally, it is clear that for a patent examiner, using the description%section of a patent application with perhaps a QR method like MMRQR%or RocchioQR will help to find the most relevant documents (to invalidate%the application). However, for inventors, before investing too much%time in writing a full patent application, we believe that it is better%to first write the abstract. Then, use Rocchio with expanded terms coming from%the claims to get the most relevant documents to make a prior art%search task (to position the current invention with related work).%These observations does not contradict with the  

In conclusion, we return to our initial objective to aid the patent
inventor in identifying an effective pre-application prior art search
strategy. Our evaluation reveals the critical insight that while querying
with a full description, perhaps combined with generic query reduction
methods, yields strong overall retrieval performance, querying with
just an abstract and using generic QE methods may yield the best trade-off
in terms of writing effort vs. retrieval performance. %Future work should investigate whether QE methods for abstract queries%can rival the best methods for description queries --- if such a result%were possible, it would significantly reduce the effort required on%behalf of the patent inventor to identify potentially invalidating%prior art for a new patent idea.

{\color{red} We claim that standard IR methods are better than patent specific ones. Do you know how other patent specific approaches (for example, the ones mentioned in the related work section) perform in comparison with standard methods like Rocchio?}
