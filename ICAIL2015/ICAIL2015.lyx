\begin_layout Abstract
Patents are used by legal entities to legally protect their inventions and
 represent a multi-billion dollar industry of licensing and litigation.
 In 2013, 302,948 patent applications were approved in the US alone -- a
 number that has doubled in the past 15 years and which makes prior art
 search a daunting, but necessary task in the patent application process.
 In this work, we seek to investigate the efficacy of prior art search strategie
s from the perspective of the inventor who wishes to assess the patentability
 of their ideas prior to writing a full application.
 While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework of the
 CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in assessing prior
 art for complete patent applications, less of this work has focused on
 patent search with queries representing partial applications.
 In the (partial) patent search setting, a query is often much longer than
 in other standard IR tasks, e.g., the description section may contain hundreds
 or even thousands of words.
 While the length of such queries may suggest query reduction strategies
 to remove irrelevant terms, intentional obfuscation and general language
 used in patents suggests that it may help to expand queries with additionally
 relevant terms.
 To assess the trade-offs among all of these pre-application prior art search
 strategies, we comparatively evaluate a variety of partial application
 search and query reformulation methods.
 Among numerous findings, querying with a full description, perhaps in conjuncti
on with generic (non-patent specific) query reduction methods, is recommended
 for best performance.
 However, we also find that querying with an abstract represents the best
 trade-off in terms of writing effort vs.
 retrieval efficacy (i.e., querying with the description sections only lead
 to marginal improvements) and that for such relatively short queries, generic
 query expansion methods help.

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Patents are used by legal entities to legally protect their inventions and

 In 2013, 302,948 patent applications were approved in the US alone

, a number that has doubled in the past 15 years.
 Given that a single existing patent may invalidate a new patent application,
 helping inventors assess the patentability of an idea through a patent
 prior art search before writing a complete patent application is an important
 task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Patent prior art search involves finding previously granted patents that
 may be relevant to a new patent application.
 The objective and challenges of standard formulations of patent prior art
 search are different from those of standard text and web search since 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2012"

\end_inset

: (i) queries are (partial) patent applications, which consist of documents
 with hundreds or thousands of words organized into several sections, while
 typical queries in text and web search constitute only a few words; and
 (ii) patent prior art search is a recall-oriented task, where the primary
 focus is to retrieve all relevant documents at early ranks, in contrast
 to text and web search that are precision-oriented, where the primary goal
 is to retrieve a subset of documents that satisfy the query intent.
 Another important characteristic of patent prior art search is that, in
 contrast to scientific and technical writers, patent writers tend to generalize
 and maximize the scope of what is protected
\color red
 
\color inherit
by a patent and potentially discourage further innovation by third parties,
 which further complicates the task of formulating effective queries.
 For instance, abstract and vague terms are sometimes pre-referred to concrete
 ones, e.g., recording means vs.
 recording apparatus; resources vs.
 battery life; machines located at point of sale locations vs.
 vending machines, etc.

\begin_layout Standard
While much of the literature inspired by the evaluation framework of the
 CLEF-IP competition has aimed to assist patent examiners in assessing prior
 art for complete patent applications, less work has focused on assessing
 the patentability of inventions before writing a full patent application.
 Furthermore, prior art search with queries that represent unfinished patent
 applications is generally desirable, since writing a full application is
 time-consuming and costly, especially if lawyers are hired to assist.
 Hence, in this paper we consider only sections which are more likely to
 be written by the inventor namely the title, the abstract, the description
 section, and an extended abstract (which we consider as the 5 first paragraphs
 of the description section), while we consider the claims section to be
 more likely to be written by a patent attorney.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 relevant (all) and irrelevant documents (top 10 irrelevant documents ranked

 We show results for the top 100 and bottom 100 queries (100 queries that
 perform the best, and 100 queries that perform the worst) of CLEP-IP 2010
 evaluated according to Mean Average Precision (MAP).
 Note that while the title section is usually composed of an average of
 six terms, the other sections are longer, ranging from ten to thousands
 of terms.
 There are three notable trends here: (i) term overlap increases from title
 to description since the query size grows accordingly; (ii) the bottom
 100 performing queries tend to have much smaller term overlap with the
 relevant documents than the top 100 queries; and (iii) even in the best
 case of querying with very long description sections, the average term
 overlap indicates many terms of relevant documents are not found in the
 query.

 tasks.

Similar observations in the general patent prior art search literature

 objective of assessing not only the performance of standard query reformulation
 methods, but also the effectiveness of query reformulation methods that
 exploit patent-specific characteristics.

In summary, to aid the patent inventor in developing an effective pre-applicatio

 The Rocchio algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Salton1971"

\end_inset

 is a classic algorithm of relevance feedback used mainly for query expansion.
 In brief, it provides a method of incorporating relevance feedback information
 into the vector space model representing a query 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Manning2008"

\end_inset

.
 The underlying theory behind Rocchio is to find a query vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{Q'}$
\end_inset

, that maximizes similarity with relevant documents while minimizing similarity
 with irrelevant documents.
 Typically, a pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) set of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 top ranked documents obtained after an initial run of the query is considered
 as the set of relevant documents to build 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{Q'}$
\end_inset

.
 We refer to this method as RocchioQE.

Similarly, Rocchio can be used as a QR method.
 Basically, the idea is that once the Rocchio-modified query vector has
 been computed, it is possible to select only the terms that appear in the
 initial query 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and rank them using the Rocchio score and finally, select the top 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 terms with the highest score to build 
\begin_inset Formula $Q'$

 We refer to this approach as RocchioQR.

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of QE, we call this diversified expansion method MMR Query Expansion
 (MMRQE).
 MMRQE takes as input a PRF set, which is used to build a document-term
 matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 documents and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 terms as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Notation"

\end_inset

 (the TF-IDF is used to populate the matrix for each document vector).
 To represent the query 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 in the documents' dimension as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Notation"

\end_inset

, we use the BM25 or TF-IDF score between each document 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the query.
 Hence, given a query representation 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, MMRQE aims to select an optimal subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 terms 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}\subset D$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $|T_{k}^{*}|=k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k\ll|m|$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 is the PRD set) relevant to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 but inherently different from each other (i.e., diverse).
 This can be achieved by building 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal term 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 given the previous set of optimal term selections 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}^{*}=\{t_{1}^{*},\ldots,t_{k-1}^{*}\}$
\end_inset

 (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}^{*}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

) using the MMR diverse selection criterion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
t_{k}^{*}=\argmax_{t_{k}\notin T_{k-1}^{*}}\hspace{-0.3mm}[\lambda\cos(Q,t_{k})-\hspace{-0.3mm}(1-\lambda)\max_{t_{j}\in T_{k-1}^{*}}\cos(t_{j},t_{k})]\label{eq:MMRQE-QR}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, the first cosine similarity term measures relevance between the query
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and possible expansion term 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}$
\end_inset

 while the second term penalizes the possible expansion term according to
 its cosine similarity with any currently selected term in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 trades off relevance and diversity.
 For MMRQE, we found that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0.5$
\end_inset

 generally provide the best results, according to our experiments on the
 CLEF-IP training dataset collection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For QR, we can greedily rebuild the query from scratch, while choosing diversifi
ed terms from the query itself.
 Here, we call this approach MMR Query Reduction (MMRQR).
 Formally, given a query representation 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, MMRQR aims to select an optimal subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 terms 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}\subset Q$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $|T_{k}^{*}|=k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k<|Q|$
\end_inset

) relevant to 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 but inherently different from each other (i.e., diverse).
 This can be achieved by building 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 in a greedy manner by choosing the next optimal term 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 given the previous set of optimal term selections 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{k-1}^{*}=\{t_{1}^{*},\ldots,t_{k-1}^{*}\}$
\end_inset

 (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}^{*}=\emptyset$
\end_inset

) using an adaptation of the MMR diverse selection criterion.
 Note that we use all the sections of the patent documents in the PRF set
 to built the document-term matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 documents and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 terms shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Notation"

\end_inset

.
 For MMRQR, we found that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0.8$
\end_inset

 generally provide the best results in our experiments on the CLEF-IP dataset
 collection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key insight we want to highlight is that MMRQE does not select expansion
 terms independently as in practical usage of Rocchio, but rather it selects
 terms that have uncorrelated usage patterns across documents, thus hopefully
 encouraging diverse term selection that covers more documents for a fixed
 expansion budget 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and ideally, higher recall.

Synonym Sets for Patent Query Expansion:

 Magdy et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Magdy2011"

\end_inset

 proposed a patent query expansion method, which automatically generates
 candidate synonym sets (SynSet) for terms to use as a source of expansion
 terms.
 The idea for generating the SynSet comes from the characteristics of the
 CLEF-IP patent collection, where some of the sections in some patents are
 translated into three languages (English, French, and German).
 They used these parallel manual translations to create possible synonyms
 sets.
 Hence, for a word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 in one language which has possible translations to a set of words in another
 language 
\begin_inset Formula ${w_{1},w_{2},\ldots,w_{n}}$
\end_inset

, this set of words can be considered as synonyms or at least related to
 each other.
 The generated SynSet is used for query expansion in two ways: (i) The first
 one used the probability associated with the SynSet entries as a weight
 for each expanded term in the query (denoted WSynSet).
 Therefore, each term was replaced with its SynSet entries with the probability
 of each item in the SynSet acting as a weight to the term within the query.
 (ii) The second one neglected this associated probability and used uniform
 weighting for all synonyms of a given term (denoted USynSet).

 Mahdabi et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 proposed to build a query-specific patent lexicon based on definitions
 of the International Patent Classification (IPC).
 The lexicon is simply built by removing general and patent-specific stop-words
 from the text of IPC definition pages.
 Each entry in the lexicon is composed of a key and a value.
 The key is an IPC class and the value is a set of terms representing the
 mentioned class.
 Then, the lexicon is used to extract expansion concepts related to the
 context of the information need of a given query patent.
 To this end, the IPC class of the query patent is searched in the lexicon
 and the terms matching this class are considered as candidate expansion
 terms.
 The proposed approach tries to combine these two complementary vocabularies
 (i.e.
 terms of the query and the IPC codes).
 Note that all the levels of the IPC codes are used to build the lexicon.
 In this paper we refer to this patent query expansion method as IPC Codes.

, the authors proposed a query reduction technique, which decomposes a query
 (a patent section) into constituent text segments and computes Language
 Model (LM) similarities by calculating the probability of generating each
 segment from the top ranked documents (PRF set).
 Then, the query is reduced by removing the least similar segments from
 the query.
 We refer to this method as LMQR.

 Based on the intuition that, terms in the IPC code definition may represent
 "stop-words", especially if they are rare (infrequent in the patent application
), a query can be reduced as follows: 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%one can think to reduce a patent query as follows:
\end_layout

\end_inset

(i) For each patent application, take the definitions of the IPC codes which
 are associated to it.
 Then, (ii) rank the terms of the query according to the difference in their
 frequency in the query and their frequency in the class code definition.
 Finally, (iii) remove bottom terms of this ranking from the query (i.e.
 good terms are terms that occur a lot in the query, and few in the class
 code definition, whereas bad terms are those that occur few in the query,
 and a lot in the class code definition).
 In the evaluation section we denote this approach IPC-StopWords.

 this generally offers best retrieval performance.

Partial patent query type:

 We consider a query of a partial patent application to consist of either
 the title, the abstract, the extended abstract or the full description
 section.
 Recall that we do not consider the Claim section, since it is more likely
 to be written by a lawyer than the inventor.
 Hence, critical questions are: what part of a partial application an inventor
 should write to obtain the best search results? And what QE methods work
 best for each type of query?

\series bold
Query expansion source:
\series default
 We consider the abstract, claims, and description sections as different
 term sources to determine which section offers the best source of expansion
 terms, e.g., are words in the claims of particularly high value as expansion
 terms? We omit the use of the title as a source of expansion terms noting
 that this configuration performed poorly due to the relative sparsity of
 useful expansion terms in the titles of the PRF set.

Abstract:
\series default
 It is intended to provide a crosslinked polyrotaxane formed by crosslinking
 polyrotaxane moleculesvia chemical bonds which exhibits excellent optical
 properties in water or in an aqueous solution of sodium chloride; a compound
 having this crosslinked polyrotaxane; and a process for producing the same.
 The above object can be achieved by a crosslinked polyrotaxane having at
 least two polyrotaxane molecules, wherein linear molecules are included
 in a skewered-like state at the opening of cyclodextrin molecules and blocking
 groups are provided at both ends of the linear molecules, so as to prevent
 the cyclodextrin molecules from leaving, and cyclodextrin molecules in
 at least two polyrotaxane molecules being bonded to each other via chemical
 bond, characterized in that hydroxyl (-OH) groups in the cyclodextrin molecules
 are partly substituted with non-ionic groups.

Abstract:
\series default
 The fire-rated recessed downlight includes a mantle.
 A radiating mouth (4) is defined in the mantle.
 A dilatable fireproof piece (5) is fixed in the radiating mouth (4).
 Radiating apertures (6 or 6') corresponding to the radiating mouth (4)
 is defined in the dilatable fireproof piece (5) or between edges of the
 dilatable fireproof piece (5) and edges of the radiating mouth (4).
 The radiating mouth (4) of the mantle and the dilatable fireproof piece
 (5) could help to radiate the heat in ordinary situation and the dilatable
 fireproof piece (5) will expand rapidly to close the radiating mouth (4)
 when on fire, therefore the fire inside the mantle will not spread to the
 outside.

 show the MAP and PRES obtained for all the QE methods (on CLEF-IP 2010
 and CLEF-IP 2011), while selecting the optimal number of terms used for
 the expansion (the number of terms that maximizes the performance for each
 method).
 From these results, we make the following observations: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The best partial application section to use for querying is the description
 section.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

%(see Figure 
\backslash
ref{fig:qDescription-PRES-CLEF-IP2010}).
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We attribute this to the fact that the description section has more content
 along with relevant terms that define the invention since a detailed summary
 of the invention is described therein.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
However, perhaps a better trade-off in terms of writing effort vs.
 retrieval performance is to query with the abstract or the extended abstract.
 Relative to the description, they take much less effort to write the abstract
 and the extended abstract.
 Further, querying with the abstract or the extended abstract provide a
 substantial boost in retrieval performance compared to the title (about
 165% for MAP).
 In contrast, querying with the description offer only marginal performance
 gains (about 10% to 30% for MAP) compared to using the abstract or the
 extended abstract.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Query expansion is not useful for very long queries (i.e.
 description) since no method outperforms the baseline.
 This indicates that in advanced writing stages of the patent preparation
 process, QE is not useful.

\begin_layout Enumerate
As for query expansion, MMRQE is less effective than Rocchio for short queries
 such as title or abstract, whereas it appears to provide slightly better
 comparative results for the medium length queries (i.e., abstract) and long
 query (i.e., description ).
 This suggests diverse term selection may be helpful for long queries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The description section does not appear to be a good source for expansion,
 likely since its content is too broad and it contains many irrelevant terms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When dealing with short and medium-length queries(i.e., title, abstract, and
 extended abstract), VSM performs better than BM25, while for very long
 queries (i.e., description), BM25 performs the best.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In general, generic QE methods like Rocchio tend to outperform patent-specific
 QE methods, although among patent-specific methods, the IPC Codes approach
 seemed to work best.

To give an insight of the effect of MMRQE and Rocchio over the performance,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tbl:QESampleQueries"

\end_inset

 shows some queries where QE methods improved the performance.
 Terms in bold are terms chosen by MMRQE, whereas terms underlined are terms
 chosen by Rocchio.
 Terms added by the two methods are both in bold and underlined.
 First of all, it is interesting to notice that even if there are common
 terms selected to expand the queries by both MMRQE and Rocchio, the lists
 of MMRQE contain more diversified terms (at least in the two first examples).
 For the two first examples, relevant patents talk about a similar idea
 than the applications, but using different examples and applications (the
 writers of a patent use complex and ambiguous terms to generalize the coverage
 of the invention).
 Hence, for the first query, key terms like: 
\shape italic
rotor, blend, and suction
\shape default
, were able to capture the scope of the relevant patents to allow either
 retrieving them (improving PRES), or pushing them to the top of the ranking
 (improving MAP).
 As for the third query, MMRQE expand the query with general terms, e.g.
 
\shape italic
result, includ, extend, plural
\shape default
, which probably encourage retrieving irrelevant patents.

 As for QE, we carry out comprehensive experiments with the following configurat

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Partial patent query type:
\series default
 We apply QR methods to a query of a partial patent application, consisting
 of the abstract, the extended abastract or the description sections.
 A critical question is what part of a partial application is best suited
 for QR? Note that we consider that there is no interest in reducing a title
 query since it already contains very few terms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Relevance model:

 We explore a probabilistic approach represented by the popular BM25

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Salton1975"

\end_inset

.
 A natural question is which relevance model works best for query reduction
 for patent prior art search? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Term selection method:
\series default
 We consider the different query reduction methods described in Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:QueryReformulation"

\end_inset

, i.e.
 RocchioQR, MMRQR, LMQR, IPC-StopWords and ask what is the best QR method
 for patent search? Further, how do these results compare to QE for the
 same queries? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 show the respective MAP and PRES performance obtained for all QR methods
 (on CLEF-IP 2010 and CLEF-IP 2011), when selecting the optimal number of
 terms removed from the original queries.
 From these results, we make the following observations: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The best performing QR methods show benefits vs.
 No QR for all queries (i.e., abstract, extended abstract and description).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The term selection methods that provide the best performance are, in general,
 MMRQR followed by RocchioQR.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When dealing with medium-length queries (i.e., abstract and extended abstract),
 VSM performs better than BM25, while for very long queries (i.e., description),
 BM25-based QR methods perform better than VSM-based QR methods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In comparison to the MAP and PRES results for QE from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:MAP-CLEF2010"

\end_inset

 and Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:PRES-CLEF2010"

\end_inset

, the best QE and QR methods perform comparably for abstract queries, whereas
 for extended abstract and description queries, the best QR method slightly
 outperforms the best QE method and No QR.
 Hence, the best overall retrieval result in this work in terms of both
 MAP and PRES comes from a description query with a generic (non-patent
 specific) QR method.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, to give an insight of the effect of MMRQR and LMQR over the performance
, Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tbl:QRSampleQueries"

\end_inset

 shows some queries where QR methods are helpful.
 Terms in bold are terms removed by MMRQR, whereas terms underlined are
 terms removed by Rocchio.
 Terms removed by the two methods are both in bold and underlined.
 First, we notice that even there are common terms removed from the original
 queries by both MMRQR and LMQR, the terms removed by MMRQR tend to be similar
 between them (e.g., 
\shape italic
laser, light, interferometer
\shape default
, in 1-Topic), which favor retaining diverse relevant terms in the query.
 However, for the third topic, MMRQR removed the main terms from the query
 (
\shape italic
motor
\shape default
, and thermal 
\shape italic
load
\shape default
), which probably decreases the quality of the query.

Abstract:
\series default
 Measurements of an interferometric measurement system are corrected for
 variations of atmospheric conditions such as pressure, temperature and
 turbulence using measurements from a second harmonic interferometer (10).
 A ramp, representing the dependence of the SHI data on path length, is
 removed before use of the SHI data.
 The SHI may use a passive Q-switched laser (11) as a light source and Brewster
 prisms (142,144) in the receiver module.
 Optical fibers may be used to conduct light to the detectors (145-147).
 A mirror reflecting the measurement beams has a coating of a thickness
 selected to minimize the sensitivity of the SHI data to changes in coating
 thickness.

 In methods for recovering and recycling helium and unreacted chlorine from
 a process for manufacturing optical fiber an exhaust gas is recovered typically
 from a consolidation furnace and is separated into helium-rich and chlorine-ric
h gas streams.
 The helium-rich stream is typically dried and blended with make-up helium
 and the chlorine-rich stream is typically purified and blended with make-up
 chlorine so that both may be reused in the optical fiber production process.

Abstract:
\series default
 An air conditioner for air conditioning the interior of a compartment includes
 a compressor (C) and an electric motor (84).
 The compressor (C) compresses refrigerant gas and changes the displacement.
 The electric motor (84) drives the compressor (C).
 A motor controller (72) rotates the motor (84) at a constant reference
 speed.
 A detection device (92) detects information related to the thermal load
 on the air conditioner.
 A current sensor (97) detects the value of current supplied to the electric
 motor.
 A controller (72) controls the compressor based on the detected thermal
 load information and the detected current value.
 The controller (72) computes a target torque of the compressor based on
 the thermal load information.
 In accordance with the computed target torque, the controller (72) computes
 a target current value to be supplied to the electric motor.
 The controller (72) further controls the displacement of the compressor
 such that the detected current value matches the target current value.

We believe the outlined patent-specific query reformulation methods described
 in Section

 circumscribe a range of patent-specific approaches spanning synonym lexicons,
 specially derived language models, and IPC code resources; hence our evaluation
 supported the objective of identifying general query reformulation methods
 from the novel perspective of partial patent application prior art search
 that may be deserving of further investigation in future work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, some more complex patent-specific methods have also been explored
 for general patent prior art search.
 The scenario of patent prior art search consists of manually form queries
 by selecting high frequency terms from patent application.
 Hence, in

 depending on the genre in the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Task.

 advocates the use of the full patent application as the query to reduce
 the burden on patent examiners.
 They conducted a series of experiments in order to examine the effect of
 different patent fields, and concludes with the observation that the best
 Mean Average Precision (MAP) is achieved using the text from the description
 section of the query patent with raw term frequencies.

 propose a query expansion with pseudo-relevance feedback.
 Query expansion terms are selected using a using a machine learning approach,
 by picking terms that may have a potential positive impact on the retrieval
 effectiveness.
 However, this approach can be computational expensive, since the presented
 features are complicated to compute, e.g.
 Pair-wise Terms Proximity features.
 Verma and Varma

 propose a different approach, which instead of using the patent text to
 query, use its International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, which are
 expanded using the citation network.
 The formed query is used to perform an initial search.
 The results are then re-ranked using queries constructed from patent text.
 Throughout our experiments, we concluded that relying on other terms to
 form a query rather than those in the patent application, leads to poor
 retrieval quality.
 Lastly, a more recent work by Mahdabi et al.

 propose a unified framework for query expansion which incorporates bibliographi
c information, IPC classifications, and temporal features to improve the
 initial query built from the query patent.
 They used the link-based structure of the citation graph together with
 the term distribution of cited documents and built a query model from the
 citation graph.
 They used the publication dates associated with the patents to adapt the
 query model to the change of vocabulary over time.
 The results showed the advantage of using the term distribution of the
 cited documents together with the publication dates.

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we analyzed various query strategies for patent prior art
 search with partial (incomplete) applications along with generic and patent-spe
cific query reformulation (expansion and reduction) methods.
 Hence in this scenario of partial patent application, we considered only
 sections, which are more likely to be written by the inventor (i.e., the
 title, the abstract, the description section, and an extended abstract).
 We performed a comprehensive comparative evaluation of these methods on
 the CLEF-IP patent corpus for prior art search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We showed that the description is the best partial application section to
 query with, followed by the extended abstract, the abstract, and lastly
 the title section.
 However, the largest boost in performance (about 165% for MAP) comes when
 switching from a title query to an abstract query or extended abstract;
 smaller relative boosts are given by querying instead with the full description
 (about 10% to 30% for MAP).
 This is a critical insight since it is substantially easier for the patent
 inventor to draft an abstract or an extended abstract rather than a full
 patent description and in doing so, still manage to retrieve the majority
 of prior art that would have been retrieved with the full description.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We observed that query expansion (QE) methods are useful for short to medium
 length queries (i.e., title, abstract, and extended abstract), but useless
 for very long queries (i.e., the description section).
 We also showed that the description section does not provide the best source
 of expansion terms for QE, rather the claims or the abstract tend to offer
 better candidate terms for QE.
 In the same vein, we also found traditional IR methods like Rocchio or
 variations to work just as well for QE (and generally better) in comparison
 with patent-specific methods that used specialized expansion sources such
 as synonym lexicons or IPC code definitions.
 For QE, future work should investigate how can we exploit patent-specific
 meta-data such as inventor and citation networks to better exploit specialized
 domains of discourse relevant to patent subfields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding query reduction (QR) methods, we showed these techniques are generally
 most effective compared to QE for the extended abstract and the description
 sections (the two longest sections used as a partial application query).
 Albeit by a slim margin over No QR, the overall best retrieval performance
 results in this work are achieved with generic (non-patent specific) QR
 methods for description queries.
 Future work may consist of exploiting query quality predictors to identify
 useless terms in a query using machine learning methods.

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, we return to our initial objective to aid the patent inventor
 in identifying an effective pre-application prior art search strategy.
 Our evaluation reveals the critical insight that while querying with a
 full description, perhaps combined with generic query reduction methods,
 yields strong overall retrieval performance, querying with just an abstract
 or and extended abstract and using generic query reformulation methods
 may yield the best trade-off in terms of writing effort vs.
 retrieval performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we believe that future work should investigate whether QE methods
 for abstract queries can rival the best methods for description queries
 --- if such a result were possible, it would significantly reduce the effort
 required on behalf of the patent inventor to identify potentially invalidating
 prior art for a new patent idea.
