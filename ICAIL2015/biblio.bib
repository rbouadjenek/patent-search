abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for the construction of a patent
test collection for the task of prior art search. Key to the justification
of the methodology is an analysis of the nature and structure of
patent documents and the patenting process. These factors enable
a corpus of patent documents to be reverse engineered in order to
arrive at high quality, realistic, relevance assessments. The paper
first outlines the case for such a prior art search test collection
along with the characteristics of patent documents, before describing
the proposed method. Further research and development will be directed
towards the application of this methodology to create a suite of
prior art search topics for the evaluation of patent retrieval systems.
We also include a preliminary analysis of its application on European
patents.},

information to weight search terms. These techniques are presented
as a natural extension of weighting methods using information about
the distribution of index terms in documents in general. A series
of relevance weighting functions is derived and is justified by theoretical
considerations. In particular, it is shown that specific weighted
search methods are implied by a general probabilistic theory of retrieval.
Different applications of relevance weighting are illustrated by
experimental results for test collections.},
