%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Baseline}

\section{Term Analysis}
The main complain about patent search is insufficient match between the content of patent queries and relevant
patents\cite{magdy2012toward, mahdabi2013leveraging}. However, our analyses showed that only \%20 overlap is sufficient for the system to retrieve a relevant or non-relevant patent at top-100 and except for few queries, non-retrieved relevant patents had enough matched term with the query. So, we start our experiments with term analysis for patent query and retrieved documents. 

\subsection{Discriminative Words}
For our initial experiments, we identified the {\em discriminative words} by positive scoring the words in relevant documents and negative scoring the irrelevant one. 
\begin{equation}
score(t,Q)=Rel(t)-Irr(t) 
 \label{eq:score}
\end{equation}
\begin{displaymath}t\in \lbrace \mbox{terms in top-100 retrieved documents}\rbrace\end{displaymath}
Where $ Rel(t) $ is the average term frequency in retrieved relevant patents and $ Irr(t) $ is the average term frequency in retrieved irrelevant patents. Words with a positive score consider {\em useful words} since they are more frequent in relevant patents while the words with negative score are {\em noisy words} as they appeared more frequently in irrelevant patents. 

Surprisingly, we could not find any correlation between the percentage of {\em useful words} and the performance. We expected a higher performance for the queries with more {\em useful words}. 

\subsubsection{Optimal RF\protect\footnote{Relevance Feedback} Query Formulation}
We hypothesize that a query formulated by {\em useful terms} is optimal since they are all frequent in relevant patents and rare in irrelevant ones. Table \ref{tab:optquery} compares the performance for baseline where the query is the full patent query both weighted and unweighed with the performance for optimal RF query weighted with the score of each term(formula \ref{eq:score}) and unweighed. 

\begin{table}[htpb]
  \begin{center}
   \caption{.}
  \input table/optquery.tex   
  \label{tab:optquery}
  \end{center}  
\end{table}

It can be seen that `MAP' jumps from 0.1618 to \textbf{0.5075} which is about \%35 increase. We use a score threshold($\tau$) to formulate the RF query(we select the terms with $ score(t)>\tau $). Fig. (1-a) indicates two important facts. First, it shows that increasing the threshold results in the lower performance. Second, the system is over-sensitive to the {\em noisy words}($ \tau<0 $).  Fig. (1-b) shows that formulating a query with up to 200 {\em useful words} helps performance whereas the performance improves slightly by adding more than 200 words. 
%Fig. 1 indicates how the score threshold and the query size control the performance.

\subsubsection{Query Reduction by Relevance Feedback}
Our experiments led us to another hypothesis that a patent query contains sufficient words matched with the relevant patents and the {\em noisy words} are the main cause of the low effectiveness. Therefore, we use RF {\em useful terms} to reduce the patent query terms by selecting terms such that: $ t \in \{ Q\cap (useful \; terms)\} $. Fig. (1-c) explicitly shows that a patent query contains sufficient words to retrieve relevant patents at top of the list. We only need to keep the {\em useful terms} and prune out the {\em noisy words}.

%   \label{fig:optpatentquery} 
%\end{figure}

\subsection{What did not Work}
We achieved a high 'MAP' by relevance feedback, however, it will cost to have relevance feedback since our users are professional patent examiners and recognizing a relevant patent is a time-taking and demanding task. 
\subsubsection{Identify the Noisy Words}

\subsubsection{Pseudo Relevance Feedback}


\subsection{Improvement by Minimum User Effort}
We showed that our attempts to improve the effectiveness without using the relevance feedback did not work. In this experiment, we select query terms using only the first relevant patent document based on the hypothesis that it will take the minimum effort for the examiner to recognize the first relevant patent at top-5.
