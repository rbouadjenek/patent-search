\chapter{Term Match Analysis}
\label{cha:analysis}
In this chapter, we mainly focus on recognizing the reasons that standard IR methods fail when the relevant patent documents are complete and in English. In fact, we will investigate what is wrong with respect to terms in both patent query and relevant documents.
