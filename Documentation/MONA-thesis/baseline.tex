\section{Errors caused by baseline settings}
Data curation and IPC filter used in baseline settings are two sources of errors;
in this section, we will discuss these two origins of the errors.

\subsection{Classification Code Mismatch}
We used International Patent Classification (IPC) code of each topic patent to filter the search results to only the patents which have at least one of the topic patent classification code. In this section, first, we briefly explain about classification code components, then we investigate how they can cause some fraction of retrieval errors.
