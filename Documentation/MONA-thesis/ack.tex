Once again, I was honored to work on another research problem advised by a great professor and researcher: Scott Sanner, in the last year he was at NICTA/ANU. His ability to formulate a research problem, as well his enthusiasm for thinking and solving a research problem incredibly encouraged me to spend long hours to implement what we had thought on a whiteboard and get the real results without being aware that I may be tired. I learned how to deal with a research problem by proposing to-the-point research questions and examine possible solutions step by step during my weekly meetings. I hope I have sufficiently learned the art of being an effective thinker for my future research career. Next, I would like to thank a great scientist who influenced me and my research career: Bob Williams. I benefited and inspired a lot from weekly seminars at NICTA and his support to attend NICTA Machine Learning Summer School.  

I would like to thank Reda Bouadjenek for his contribution to the development of the baseline system.
